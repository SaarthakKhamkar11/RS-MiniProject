# Restaurant Recommendation System

**Hybrid Context-Aware Recommender System for Personalized Restaurant Suggestions**

Restaurant Recommendation System  
T.Y. B.Tech Sem-V | A.Y: 2025-26

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive restaurant recommendation system based on the mini project specifications. The system combines collaborative filtering with contextual features to provide situationally appropriate restaurant recommendations.

## Features

### üçΩÔ∏è **Hybrid Recommendation System**
- **Baseline Model**: Collaborative filtering based on user-item ratings
- **Hybrid Model**: Context-aware recommendations considering time, day, and restaurant attributes
- **Real-time Context Analysis**: Adapts recommendations based on current time and user preferences

### üéØ **Context-Aware Features**
- **Time-based Recommendations**: Different suggestions for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night
- **Day of Week Awareness**: Weekend vs weekday preferences
- **Price Range Filtering**: Budget to premium restaurant options
- **Cuisine Preferences**: Personalized cuisine recommendations
- **Group Size Considerations**: Recommendations suitable for different group sizes
- **Special Attributes**: Kid-friendly, outdoor seating, and other restaurant features

### üìä **Advanced Analytics**
- **Performance Metrics**: Precision@10, Recall@10, NDCG@10
- **Model Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of baseline vs hybrid models
- **Context Analysis**: Real-time analysis of recommendation context

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Data Exploration and Feature Engineering
- ‚úÖ Sample Yelp dataset creation with 200 restaurants
- ‚úÖ Contextual feature extraction (day_of_week, time_slot, meal_type)
- ‚úÖ Business attribute processing and categorization
- ‚úÖ User-item matrix construction for collaborative filtering

### Phase 2: Baseline Model Implementation
- ‚úÖ Item-based collaborative filtering using cosine similarity
- ‚úÖ User rating-based recommendation generation
- ‚úÖ Cold-start problem handling for new users
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics calculation

### Phase 3: Hybrid Context-Aware Model Development
- ‚úÖ Candidate generation using collaborative filtering
- ‚úÖ Contextual re-ranking based on:
  - Time appropriateness (meal type matching)
  - Price range preferences
  - Cuisine preferences
  - Group size considerations
  - Special attributes (kid-friendly, outdoor seating)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic scoring system for context relevance

### Phase 4: Evaluation and Performance Metrics
- ‚úÖ Offline evaluation framework
- ‚úÖ Precision, Recall, and NDCG metrics
- ‚úÖ Contextual-fit analysis
- ‚úÖ Model comparison capabilities

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the system:**
   ```bash
   python run_server.py
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000
   - Frontend Interface: http://localhost:8000 (if using static server)

### Manual Setup

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend server (in another terminal):**
   ```bash
   python static_server.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Usage

### Getting Recommendations

1. **Enter User Information:**
   - User ID (e.g., "user123")
   - Current time and date
   - Meal type preference

2. **Set Preferences:**
   - Price range
   - Preferred cuisine
   - Group size
   - Special requirements (kid-friendly, outdoor seating)

3. **Get Recommendations:**
   - Click "Get Recommendations" to see results
   - Switch between "Hybrid Context-Aware" and "Baseline Collaborative Filtering" models
   - View performance metrics and context analysis

### Understanding the Results

- **Restaurant Cards**: Show name, cuisine, rating, address, hours, and attributes
- **Recommendation Score**: Context-aware relevance score
- **Model Comparison**: Compare performance between baseline and hybrid models
- **Context Analysis**: See how your preferences influenced the recommendations
