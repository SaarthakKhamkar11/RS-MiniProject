The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\n\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \n\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \n\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \n\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.", "date": "2016-05-31 02:14:54"}

It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  \n\nThe property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  \n\nRoom: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  \n\nCheckout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.", "date": "2013-08-03 16:26:48"}

Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the \"wrong\" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. \n\nWe came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. \n\nWe got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!\n\nWe also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)\n\nThe ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!\n\nBy the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires. I parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier. It was free on a Monday late afternoon.", "date": "2015-08-19 04:11:47"}

We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a \"to go\" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say \"we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried.\" It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! \nTime that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.\nI should have listened to the other reviews about the shitty service here. \nDon't waste your time or money!!!\nStay away!

The shake was nothing fancy, but perfectly made, creamy, not too sweet or over-chocolatey. \nIf you want your upscale burger experience but still want your burger-fries-shake holy trinity, come here.", "date": "2016-03-07 01:47:53"}

The complimentary bread and butter was very nice. My husband and I started off with the seafood gumbo, and it was delicious! Both of us had a sea bass entree and it was definitely the best fish I've ever had. The fish came with a side of green beans and this DELICIOUS sauce that could make anything taste great. We finished off with chocolate orange ice cream and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. The next table over was raving about their bread pudding, so I'm guessing dessert is usually a hit all around at this place. \n\nThe coolest bit about my experience here was that my husband and I got seated where Ronald Reagan sat on his two visits to Mr. B's (far left corner)- Reagan just so happened to visit on my birthday! \n\nOur bill came out to be $100+ but it was worth every penny.

Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). \n\nI've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The \"onion rings\" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!\n\nThe service is generally pretty attentive (once you're seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value", "date": "2014-09-10 06:18:19"}

Panini was amazing. Great use of garlic. Loved the cut of the meat. Not stringy but nicely chinked in thin slices. Cheese was well melted throughout the mix of kraut and meat. Rye Bread was wonderful. Would love to have it as a staple in my house. \n\nSalad came out same time as sandwich which was not good.\n\nPresentation was a little sloppy. \n\nLike every other place I have had a panini (except Panera where they do it right), the sandwich was served directly on a plate. Why don't they serve on a napkin? Particularly when they bring the salad out at the same time as the sandwich?  If the sandwich sits for more than a few moments, the bread gets soggy from the steam.  Nothing serious, but for the price, which is a little high, it seems lacking.  While the price is a little high, i think it is justified considering the food and drink quality. \n\nThey have a great selection of wines and beers that are likely to fit any palette.  \n\nWait staff have always been friendly. But you can tell this is a place where people are expected to hustle. Sometimes short or even distracted the service can be lacking. \n\nThe second time I visited was during a medium lunch rush and the wait time was 15 min to get drinks.

I wonder how many people know that an Ouzaria is?  The ambience here is definitely upbeat - I'd rate it a great place for a group or first date.  They have a couple of semi-secluded tables in the back room that keeps it from getting too loud, but it's not a quiet romantic place.  \n\nWe brought my Mother-in-Law, who enjoys good food as long as it's not too weird.  I guess my wife is about the same, now that I think about it.  We tried three tapas plates; a three-cheese sampler, featuring feta, goat cheese and kasseri cheese, greek meatballs and pan-seared scallops.  We liked all three of these dishes.  The scallops were especially good - big and tender.   For tapas, they were pretty big portions, so keep this in mind.  The waitress suggested ordering one thing at a time, but we didn't heed her advice and ordered it all up front.   Two at a time would probably be a good idea.  Along with the tapas, we ordered a traditional Greek salad, which ended up being the lone clunker, surprisingly.  We just didn't like the dressing - too sweet for our tastes.  The gyro meat was fine, though, so maybe we'll just get a gyro next time.   One more thing:  The Spanish granacha (can't remember the label) was excellent for just $6 and a nice pour. \n\nOkay, now for the belly dancer:  She was cute and a good dancer, but I think this is just something that requires more alcohol on my part.  We did have a few laughs about it, though.  I opted not to get a dollar out to stuff in her skirt or whatever.   Fun but a little awkward. \n\nI've been to a few other Greek places in town that had better food, but for a night out, Momo's is definitely the choice.

The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It's an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you'll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area. \n\n2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, \"I don't know\" as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.\n\n3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It's horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don't stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.\n\n4. The size: It's no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It's inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a \"quick bite\" is not possible here. And there's not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.\n\nI'm sure glad I was there for a convention and didn't pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel.", "date": "2008-04-29 20:03:45"}

We took a boat ride given by \"Delta River Boat Tours\" which was a cute little boat on a track in their indoor river with a sweet southern tour guide letting us in on all the \"fascinating\" facts about the hotel.

Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.\n\nAnyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.\n\nWhile we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.\n- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. \n- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.\n- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. \n- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.\n- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.\n\nSo to sum up, first visit (of what I'm sure will be many) was pretty good.

I was excited, when I heard this, because Kinnikinnick's bread is not very good. It's like eating bricks, and it took me years to get used to it; not to mention, it only really tastes good when it's toasted. \n\nI've tried Breadland's arrowroot gluten-free buns. These are indeed very good. They are very soft and the outside is chewy, and they taste great with just about anything: butter, hummus, melted cheese, or peanut butter & jam. The only problem is that I can't eat them, because they give me really bad eczema on my face. I suspect it's all the yeast they put in it. The focaccia gluten-free bread they sell is also really good. This is like a thick flat bread that is flavoured with tons of herbs and I think some garlic too. It's so good, and although it contains yeast, I don't get eczema, so it must not be that much. \n\nThese breads are very expensive though, so I only get them as a treat.", "date": "2008-12-04 08:03:31"}

Well, I guess a few minutes means twenty because our waitress sat at a table conversing with a couple instead of coming back to assist us.

We dined here last night, and were very happy. The ambiance and interior design are top notch. It's very impressive how the space has been transformed from the previous tenant. The food was outstanding, which is unsurprising considering the chef's pedigree. We had two lovely cocktails and a whole fish that was perfectly cooked along with a terrific short rib play on stroganoff. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that those cocktails and two entrees ended up costing $140. The Love is really good, but it's also surprisingly expensive. Entrees are priced in the $30-$40 range and appetizers and pastas are not far behind. The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant, and it would be, perhaps, the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third. As is, it's as expensive as any non-tasting menu restaurant in Philly. Is that worth it when you can eat for less up the block at Vernick, etc? I'm not totally sure. I'll definitely be back, and I hope the menu prices find an equilibrium with the awesome vibe and food--I'd love to make it a real regular haunt.", "date": "2017-11-18 23:43:27"}

A friend was in town and after a day at Busch Gardens we were starved.  I remembered seeing Tsunami when  I was at the nearby Home Depot and the place looked appealing.  I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  For a Holiday weekend it was crowded, but it didn't take too long to get seated at a Hibachi table.  I have been a huge Benihana fan in the past and enjoy this style of restaurant.  I noticed there were a lot of drinks specials on the menu and the pricing seemed very reasonable compared to Benihana.  There was one guest at the table who had a lot of questions and special requests which took some time to get sorted out, but once she was accommodated, the service moved more quickly.  Not the servers fault.  The portions were huge!  I also didn't expect to get noodles in addition to rice, but it made for some quality left overs the next day.  I ordered the shrimp, scallop and filet teppanyaki and like I stated prior the portions were generous, the fried rice was ok, just rice and egg, no veggies or proteins mixed in - pretty basic, but it was well seasoned.  I was impressed with the scallops and the shrimp and quality of the filet.  All was cooked properly, and the chef was entertaining and efficient.  While the reviews for Tsunami were mixed on Yelp, I would not hesitate to come back and bring friends.  It was an enjoyable experience and a good value.", "date": "2016-09-06 00:57:55"}

For some reason, I wasn't feeling it in the main dining area (where we sat). I guess that's the idea and maybe we should have asked to sit in a different area. Part of it may have to do with the fact that we were the youngest people in the place by about 40 years. We could hear the commotion in the kitchen, which was weird because it didn't seem like we were that close to it. Next time I would request to be seated elsewhere.\nService-\nOur waitress was alright, she just seemed a little out of place. She broke a dish on the floor, and overall was a bit sloppy. She was nice enough though, and checked on us an adequate amount. \nFood- \nI loved the fact that there was the option to order petite serving, which upon arrival to our table seemed laughable.

The convention center area itself is huge, with gorgeous carpeting, interior decor, etc. all around. There are frequently events and meetings at the convention center, so it's always pretty busy.

As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the entire area is enclosed, but it really feels like you are outside walking around in an outdoor garden that is always kept at a nice breezy 75 degrees or so. This in itself just amazes me. There are winding paths (nothing super strenuous), waterfalls, and beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere. There are quite a few shops and restaurants all around the hotel, but the pricing is pretty expensive (I will give a shoutout to Stax though -- a delicious make-your-own burger place).

Why?  Because this place has one of the most generous menus as far as choices go.  There is a ton to choose from, even if you're vegetarian.  \nFormalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.\nAn early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. \nEntrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected \"spicy\" as our seasoning level.  I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.  But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived!  We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire.  Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through.  The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess.\nI'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings.  I am humbled however by their spiciness--something that has not happened to me in many many years.  Next time, I am going to stick with \"medium\" spiciness!", "date": "2011-02-14 18:01:48"}

They also tout that the food is prepared without butter or ghee.  Um - I am not sure this is a good thing.  I enjoy the richness of Indian food; if I want light, I'll get a salad or something Mediterranean. The mumbai dal (a lentil dish) was so saucy and skimpy on the lentils that it might as well have been a broth-based soup.\n\nIn spite of my gripes, I do expect I will go back to Mumbai Bistro.  They fill a void for low-key, inexpensive Indian takeout in the immediate neighborhood.  They have a few tables set up to eat it, but it looks like their primary business is simple take-out.  The food (while somewhat uninspired) was all cooked well, and seemed fresh and hot in the buffet.  The space is clean, and the staff have all been friendly.

For the birthday person I requested the bread pudding-pretty presentation but improvement on the recipe needed- too dry, either microwaved too much or not enough moisture in the recipe- glad it was comp'd-would not have been happy to have paid for it. \nOverall the atmosphere was nice, pretty renovation of the place that used to be a Copeland's, all of the condiments were served in little cups, which was ok but a squeeze bottle of Blue Plate mayo was on the table, very out of place, but at least it was Blue Plate (the only mayo of Louisiana!).

I was walking back to my car from ACME, when I spotted a fisherman who was parked and selling his fresh shrimp catch to a chef out on the street.  I took one quick look at his catch and found the most wonderful looking jumbo shrimp I had ever laid eyes on.  Not your standard jumbo, but real JUMBO.  Huge tasty looking shrimp!\n\nI was compelled--even though I had just gorged myself on chargrilled oysters and a po'boy--to inquire about these shrimp of his.  I asked him, \"excuse me, sir, where is the absolute best place to eat those shrimp of yours around here?\"\n\nHis answer: \"Mr B's, you have to try the BBQ shrimp there for sure\"\n\nWho dat?  Mr B's dat.  My convinced my coworker (which wasn't to difficult) to come with me to try the BBQ shrimp.  We quickly sat at the bar, as we had already eaten lunch, and requested an order of BBQ shrimp to share.\n\nWhen the shrimp came to us, and we took that first bite (after peeling the shrimp, of course), we found ourselves in decapod heaven.  They were served swimming (no pun intended) in a delectable buttery/spicy sauce, which was truly amazing.  The smokey and spicy flavors of the sauce were infused into the shrimp, which is truly no small feat.  The best part about a sauce like this is that it seems to build in nuance and intensity with each bite.  Each shrimp, as a result, seemed better than the one just before it.\n\nI was so amazed, that I returned the very next day for another order of BBQ shrimp, to be split with a different friend.  I take great pleasure in sharing the things I truly enjoy with friends, and what better way to do that than over a bowl of BBQ shrimp at Mr. B's?", "date": "2010-10-06 08:18:12"}

Much like other people have expressed, I was weary about any type of Barre class; I didn't like the whole \"stigma\" that went along with it. My workouts have always consisted of kickboxing and weight lifting. A couple months ago I hurt my shoulder weight lifting and the PT told me to avoid anything to do with weights/pull-ups etc for months until it healed. After having two knee surgeries this year, I didn't want to push my luck hurting my body any further. I decided to join Barre and see what it was all about since it seemed to be low impact. I wasn't really expecting a lot going into it as I didn't possibly see how doing pilates/ballets moves could actually give me a good work out. 15 minutes into the first class I was greatly humbled. I was fatiguing parts of my body that hadn't been worked in years, I never imagined those \"tiny\" movements would have such a huge impact. I've been going to Barre for a couple months now, and it does not get easier. Oddly enough, the more you go the harder it becomes. You learn how to really dig deep and and push yourself to the edge. It took me awhile to consciously remember to keep my belly button tucked to my spine and my hips squared, but this makes such a huge difference in your results. I'm constantly on the go and these 60 minutes remind to calm down, breathe, and focus on myself; its not just a physical workout for me, but it helps me mentally as well.\n\nAs far as the studio itself and the staff are concerned, I don't know if I just have been really lucky in finding an amazing studio or if the entire Barre3 organization is like this, but I cannot say enough positive things about them. From day one they made me feel right at home. In the beginning of every single class the instructor goes around and introduces themselves to each person in the class and asks if anyone has any injuries so they can take that into account. The entire 60 minute workout the instructors are talking/walking you through each and every one of the poses. The try to push you to your edge, but also remind you to listen and respect your body. For any one of the poses/movements they show, they also offer modifications, which is incredibly helpful, especially for someone trying to rehab and injury. Sometimes when you are working out in a group you don't want to take the modifications because you don't want to look 'weak' compared to everyone else, but they are so encouraging and supportive that you never feel this way; some of the instructors do the modifications themselves as well! I recently went back home for a visit. While I was there I stopped by my old kickboxing studio to say \"hello\" to everyone and take a quick class. Everyone was complimenting me how great I looked and asked what gym I had joined. They were shocked to learn the only thing I had done was join Barre3. I never imagined in a million years that I would fall in love with Barre3, but my experience here has been nothing short of wonderful.", "date": "2015-11-18 18:00:15"}

I visited my sister in LA and she sprung on the great surprise that we were headin' to Santa Barbara for the weekend.  \n\nThe Shellfish Company sits on the end of the Stern's Warf which is one of the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From the outside you can see the tanks of fresh Abalone, Dungeness Crab, and the infamous Spider Crab.  You must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit.  The inside is a classic, you are here for the food not the ambiance,  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating (be careful it can get windy). My sister and I sat at the bar.  The bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some.   We, however, were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staff/bartenders who were really awesome; enjoying life kinda people - they tipped it to the official 5 star review. \n\nWe started with the Abalone for an appetizer which was really good; perfectly seasoned and cooked. I also had to try the chowder - awesome, but Maine's is better!   They have a decent array of beers on tap and I chose a local brew.  For dinner we split the Spider Crab cause we ain't scared of shh... ok, maybe I was a little....it was huge!!!  The dinner combo, I believe, came with choice of soup or salad.  Splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people. I recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood.  My one critique is that I thought the Spider Crab was over cooked.  It by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but I know my seafood. \n\nOverall one of the best experiences ever.  If you go to Santa Barbra you MUST go here!", "date": "2012-03-02 16:51:33"}

We've been trying sushi restaurants in the SJ/Philly area, usually about once a month for the last few months and so far all have been pretty good. Akira made no exception. The staff was friendly and prompt and we were seated immediately in the first dining area (next time we'll try the hibachi experience). The booth was very comfortable and we both liked the decor. \n\nWe started off with the buttered fried calamari. It was so-so. The texture was a bit chewy and the breading wasn't very flavorful. The amount we received was also on the light side. I doubt we'll get this again next time around. \n\nFor our entre, we ordered a California roll, spicy tuna roll, the Diga roll and the Eagle roll. All were excellent and the highlight of our meal. The smokey flavor and subtle mix of heat of the Diga roll was incredible. Get it. You won't be disappointed. \n\nThe reason I'm giving this 3.5 stars and not a 4 is because the calamari wasn't very good and their prices are a bit steep for their specialty rolls. You can get cheaper prices and more for your dollar at Mega Sushi or Crazy Sushi in the city or Sagami on rt 130. That being said I'm sure we'll be back if we can snag another Living Social deal to Akira.", "date": "2013-12-07 15:29:28"}

It's a shame it's so small, as it makes it NOT a good choice for one of those Friday nights when you're like \"hey, why don't we...?\"  But, I'll forgive it for its smallness and move on to my fav things there.\nThe first time I ever went there like 5 years ago, I got the El Fino Wrap (it's this wrap with poached pears, gorgonzola cheese, toasted (i think) pecans and maybe some dried cranberries and onion?), and I almost passed away it was so amazing. To this day it's still my favorite thing there, and in my top 5 favorite foods on earth.  They don't have it on the dinner menu though, but you can always order it.  THAT is my ultimate fav.\nIn terms of soup - they are like soupmakers from the future.  Flavor combos I've never heard of warm ginormous bowls. The thai carrot soup makes me want to live in Thailand and become a carrot farmer.  They drizzle this creme fraiche on top and.... yeah.  You get it.  I also had this really awesome beet soup there... Which reminds me...\nThose crazy cooks at Blue Sage are like Masters of the Beet.  In fact, I was not aware of the degree at which I adore the beet until I'd seen it cooked/utilized about 5 different ways there. It's awesome.\nThen it's like, okay.... What else could they do to be Awesome McAwesometon?  Oh, they could have world-class desserts (w vegan options too) that make you want to setup a little cot and just live in their dining room.\nSo, obviously, I love this place.\nOne more thing - I prefer Blue Sage for lunch.  The options are there, it's cheaper, and they actually have more stuff I like on the lunch menu.\nDInner gets a little too grainy for me - literally.  I mean, I like quinoa, but it just doesn't wow me like the lunch stuff does.  Na mean?\nHearts out to the Sage.", "date": "2008-12-04 14:32:25"}

She ignored me as she was watching him and I repeated twice that my party was complete. She finally decided to talk to me and informed me that the stroller cannot go by our table.

I was shocked and wanted to hit her hand out of my face. However, being in a nice place I kept it in and just walked away. The male hostess sat us at a table that had booth seating. He pulled the table out for some of us to slide in and he walked away! So the rest of the party pushed the table back.

What better food than a burger?! We're out of town and didn't know what was available (other than the typical fast food joints and Five Guys). We narrowed our search to Burger Up and Cheeseburger Charley's. We settled on Burger Up and boy am I glad.\n\nI'm a fairly picky eater and hamburgers are one of my favorite foods. Unfortunately, all too many places really mess-up a hamburger (Five Guys included). We read some reviews here on yelp and still couldn't be certain we were making the right decision. Someone complained about \"family style seating\" (sitting with strangers) and another mentioned a \"dorked-up\" PB&J.\n\nFirst, let me say that the decor was quite unique. There were only a few tables where you risk sitting with strangers and I'm certain you could tell the hostess that wouldn't be preferable. Honestly, though, life's short. Chill-out and make the best of it. Are you really that unsociable?! The menu plainly states that it's grilled. Who's ever eaten a grilled PB&J?! If that's not what you're looking for, don't order it.\n\nFinally, for the burgers...\n\nI ordered the classic burger with white cheddar cheese and was completely satisfied. Someone complained that it was dry. You must have gone on an \"off\" night, because our burgers were juicy and quite tasty. The server told us that we could opt for Heinz ketchup, if we didn't like their house ketchup, but who wouldn't like their house ketchup? Good stuff. You also have a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. We didn't get regular fries, but their sweet potato fries were great, too!\n\nOkay, so no restaurant is perfect. Our server, Daniel, was great. Ambiance and food was great. The sweat tea was not good, nor was the lemonade.\n\nThere you have it. What they are known for -- burgers -- were definitely worth it. I think someone complained about the cost. We spent $35.00 for two, but where do you not spend that much for two (including a tip).\n\nWe'll definitely be back...", "date": "2012-05-28 21:52:06"}

I had wanted to go to BST back in the day and never made it but it really hasn't been on my list for a while. When we got the invite I was glad to accept. Good friends,I assumed food decent at worst, so sounded like fun. \nThe setting . Big warehouse style building between 2 somewheres. 4th floor overlooking quasi industrialish part of the river. The crowd. Well it is a bit older. Median age 60 or 60+. The restaurant. They take the space and try to make as many tables as possible by the window overlooking river. \nOk let's get down to food. We were 4. Opposite husband ordered crab gallette. I'm not a big sharer with other couples. It did look good. Somewhere between a cake and a mousse. He finished it. The wife got the vegetarian app. Lots of good choices on the menu imo. I wouldn't order but whatever. I ordered the escargots with sauteed mushrooms and red burgundy sauce. Honestly if this dish were at Ela or Stateside they'd add a lil jazz and the hipsters would be going batshit crazy. This was a very good dish. Red burgundy sauce just matched with snails and mushrooms so well. It was a grab an extra roll to sop it up kind of sauce. And the snails were nice and tender. My wife got the cold local corn soup. Well executed but I'm just not a huge cold corn fan. Very summer sweet.\nMains. Opposing husband got the salmon. Looked ok. Seemed a bit better done than  I prefer but I struggle all the time with this. Sauce looked nice. I got a scallop dish with sauteed veggies, potatoes and a bouillabaise sauce. Very nice. Sauce excellent. Scallops cooked properly. Not a home run but good food. My wife got the home run. Hangar steak cooked medium rare sliced down and in a red burgundy sauce. Side of green lentils. Hangar was perfectly cooked and had that extra meaty flavor that a good hangar steak should have. Burgundy sauce they just do it right. Wonderful dish.\nWe didn't order desert.\nHere's the deal. Apps were 10-12 bucks. My escargots were $10. That's crazy cheap. The entrees were $23ish. Good quality. $5 less than many places. Wine was all Moore Brothers stuff.. No trophy wines just wine meant to be good drinking wine with food. And reasonably priced\nIt's not on the hipster to do list right now. But the food is very good for the price and if you renamed this restaurant and reopened it in a different section of the city it might be packed. Unfortunate but that's the way things work.

The host was very nice and was trying her best. \n We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes \" what did you have\" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with \"oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen\" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. \n  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes \" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food\" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here.

So, liquor bar it truly is, but amazing food it definitely has.\n\nBut: the bites are pretty killer, from what I experienced. For what they seemingly lack in a way of app and entree selection they more than make up for with the quality, care, and innovation of their offerings.\n\nI landed after a long day of travel, famished. My lovely host, Brit S, picked me up from the airport, and after situating myself at the Conrad, we hopped the whole two blocks over to the Libertine.\n\n(It should be noted that former Indy CM Jon A also highly suggested checking this place out.)\n\nThe space is long and lean, with a formidable bar set-up and bottles for days behind the bar. Bitters and fruit and tinctures and all that, you know the drill at this point. The \"kitchen\" is also behind the bar, and the whole thing is grey and low light and trees/antlers and candlelight and warm and really nice smells. It sort of reminded me of a less formal Hinterland (located in MKE). Employees rock the whole Stumptown coffee look, but they're not nearly as in yr face with it as Stumptown is.\n\nOh, yeah. I was telling a mildly entertaining story with linear progression, wasn't I? \n\nSo: I was *famished,* and wanted nothing more than to start w/ one of their amazing cocktails, but knew I needed to put something in that stomach of mine first.\n\nSo... to the eats.\n\n1. A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?\n\n2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.\n\nThe rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.\n\nAnyways, moving on (and this is important). To the cocktail: our very attentive/sweet server and I talked through a myriad of offerings and possibilities, and after much ado about bourbon, we settled on a variation of Seelbach with a locally aged bourbon.

I was already heading to TN to visit some family so my mom & I decided to use the Groupon the night before I left so we'd be close to the airport.  We had both been to the hotel in the past (prior to the flood) and thought it was so gorgeous & we couldn't wait to actually stay here & see what the room would look like.  According to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn't the case at all.  \n\nFirst off, their parking has gone up & is now $18 per night to park in a lot that doesn't shuttle you & your luggage to the main hotel, you have to walk.  If you choose to valet the cost is $24 per night which I have a huge issue with...the parking is outside in their own lot, this is not a major city like NYC where parking is limited so I feel that charging people to park & walk is a bit ridiculous, I can see charging $5/10 for valet but charging me to park my own car & shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates.  How are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park?  \n\nThe hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring...it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table & 2 armchairs, it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated \"Our suites include a moderate-size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings\".  This led me to believe that we wouldn't be sleeping in the moderate sized living room & have no bedroom at all.  At no time during booking or check in was I asked how many beds I wanted & since I thought our suite had bedroom(s) I didn't ask & when we got to the room we had 1 king.  I called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room & why it only had 1 bed & I was told \"our Jr. suite is just 1 large room & you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted\" I replied \"I was never asked during booking or check in what I wanted\" I was then told \"well, if you want to change to 2 beds I can transfer you to the front desk & you can see if they have anything available\" and I said \"no, I don't want the hassle I guess we can just share the bed\" and was told \"OK, sorry you are disappointed\".  The guest services person didn't offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me, she didn't offer to move us to a garden view room (which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite) or offer any other solutions either & I was really disappointed with that.\n\nOnce we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed & hit the hotel to shop, eat, cocktail & check out the murals & water shows.  First off we tried to find the water show & weren't having any luck so we proceeded to shop & asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them & she said \"oh, they aren't running tonight\" so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in.  After a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking...we hit up Fuse & each had 1 drink & our bill was $19 so we moved on to dinner at Jack Daniels which was so good & reasonable priced.  I think our total bill was under $40 & we didn't have any drinks but we did have leftovers!!  After dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex.  After all of that I took an Ambien & slept really well until about  7 am when I could hear people talking in the hallway & room doors closing one after the other.  My mom said she slept for s**t because of all of the noise & it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable.  \n\nI'm sure that if everything we wanted to see & do would have been available to us this wouldn't have seemed like such a let down & the boring room wouldn't have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren't able to do anything that was on our list I would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony & people watch.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, the lush greenery & the beautiful architecture as well as the shopping & food are all amazing but as a guest I left feeling pretty let down.", "date": "2012-03-01 21:23:50"}

When my work declared happy hour at this location, how could I not resist beating rush hour traffic to order my favorite craft beers?\n\nNow, I'm a fan of porters and stouts, so ML Rose never disappoints. This time, I ordered the Highland Black Mocha Stout from Asheville, NC which went down ever-so smoothly. It was quite frankly like drinking velvet. I've had the Japa Milk Chai stout in the past and was similarly thrilled. ML Rose is to beer as Nashville is to country music: it is the definitive marker of what beer goes. Period.\n\nIf you happen to be a huge fan of bar food, this location does not disappoint. I particularly appreciated the generous portion on my Carolina Sweets order. So, let me explain this magnificent paragon of culinary achievement: perfectly crunchy sweet potato waffle fries hugged by dollops of pulled pork, all smothered with a carolina mustard bbq and kissed by a few diced green onions. Talk about food that hits every tastebud high note: savory, sweet, sour, and (with a kick of hot sauce from your table) just a bit spicy. I suggest saving the entire plate for yourself because you will not be inclined to share. Trust me, this dish inspires selfishness in us all. While I have tried the Five Alarm Burger, I admit that what truly sticks out is the Caroline Sweets dish due to satisfaction alone. Bar none.\n\nBecause we did come in such a large party, I do believe the waitstaff struggled to handle the numbers. Beers were delivered late or could not be ordered due to busyness, orders were forgotten or delivered to the wrong people. Common mishaps considering the huge party that we made up. However, the quality of my food and beer were still spot on, despite my beer gazing at me from afar (for far too long). \n\nI would suggest the Charlotte location if you are looking for a less busy location, but this one is fun since it has a lovely beer garden in the back. Eat, drink, be merry at M.L. Rose. It's diner paradise for sure.", "date": "2016-11-22 00:15:52"}

We have had bread pudding after every meal while we have been here and this was, by far, the best.  We also got the bourbon infused pecan pie, which was delicious, especially if you like the taste of bourbon.\n\nThe entrees, however, were just average in my opinion.  I did not think the rabbit was very good at all, even though it is supposed to be the house specialty.  The oyster dressing that came with it was very sagey.  \n\nWe also got the trio sampler, which had way too much dried parsley as a garnish.  The Shrimp & Chicken Andouille Jambalaya was good, but there was only a small scoop of that.  The sausage, in particular, was delicious.  The blackened fish filet turned out to be catfish, which I do not really care for.  The Crawfish \u00c9touff\u00e9e had good flavor, but they put it over top of the catfish, which took away from the flavor of the fish and did not let the Etouffee shine - I would have liked to see it separated.  \n\nWe got some cornbread with our meal, which was decadent - I know that seems like an odd word to describe cornbread, but it was.  A generous mixture of melted butter and honey was poured over the top of the bread and made it amazing.  \n\nWe did not have one, but they have a homemade hurricane that is steeping in a glass cooler with all kinds of fruit - it looks like it would have tasted amazing.

Everything sounds great right? Pizza tastes good, wings taste good. Me being slightly... buzzed thought nothing of the bill... after all my main mission was to get Pizza. It wasn't until I collected myself this morning that I realized how ridiculous it was that I spent 32 bucks on a pep pizza and a dozen wings. I think you guys can do the math. I got fleeced in my moment of drunkin pizza need. Anyway, go next door. These guys can't operate like decent human beings.

One way to downtown in Taxi is $25 or the Gaylord shuttle is $30 something for Roundtrip...but the last pickup was a little too early for my liking. \n\n-The city bus doesn't come very often and doesn't run late. But a way cheaper way to get into town. ($1.60) \n\n-The restaurants are expensive and they don't have any local appeal. When I'm traveling, I want to eat local fare. Why isn't there southern food, bbq? \n\n-I feel like they basically want you to stay on their property the entire time! \n\n-Expensive!

Full of flavor and huge portions. I tried pulled pork, baked beans, and corn pudding. Among the best baked beans I've ever had. My husband thought the pulled chicken had a bit of a bitter taste and his Mac and cheese looked a little bland. He offered to let me try it, but I would have had to share my beans and, despite the love I have for the man, I didn't want to. I deducted one star on behalf of his bitter chicken. Definitely recommend the restaurant, though.", "date": "2018-02-24 18:47:03"}

I wish their pastries included some kind of iced cinnamon roll mostly because that's a favorite of mine but also because it would have been more festive than the small muffins which were a\nBit dry - the glazed donut/ roll was good though .  The only real issue was that the drink station - serve themselves coffee and hot water in thermal vessels and juices plus champagne to make mimosas - was not out until about 30 minutes after guests arrived -- and the juice carafes were very small - almost like what you'd place on one table so kept needing refill ( I think when it appears like there is only a small amount guests will be influenced to not tAke much out of politeness so should look plentiful ) also twice when I went for coffee it was empty -- although they did refill it when asked .  \nThe staff was very pleasant - the bartender was helpful and good about our taking up his entire bar top .  \nI'd highly recommend this as a party venue or just as a good brunch place", "date": "2018-05-29 00:59:01"}

We ordered oysters and none of them were cut properly so we had to scrape them out with our forks before we could eat them. After our appetizers came my boyfriends grandfather had to use the restroom and when we came back he told us there wasn't any soap so he told one of the employees. He intended to go wash his hands when our meals came out so that they would have plenty of time to refill the soap. Our meals came and he went back in the bathroom and the soap still wasn't refilled. Luckily, we had our own bottle of hand sanitizer with us so he had to resort to using hand sanitizer before eating his meal. The worst part is that he ordered a lobster roll. So it wasn't like he was eating with silverware. He had to eat his birthday meal with his hands that he couldn't even get soap to wash.

Well as we sat and waited we noticed that everyone that came in after us no matter how many other people put their name on the list it was always 45-60 minutes.

After we ordered I joked with my wife that they might run out of food which was the wrong thing to do because they did run out of the steak. I do not run a restaurant but I find it very strange that they would run out of a staple dinner on a Saturday night when it was not on special. So I had to get the pork chops. Well while my wife's dinner was good the pork chops were so dry that it needed a sauce or something to make them edible. Also I got about two spoonfuls of rice and three measly carrots.

Lesson learned the hard way. Never in my life have I been more disgusted with customer service, this establishment doesnt even deserve one star. As a professional event planner, I am very organized and always check my reservations. I have been planning my best friends bachelorette party since April, and booked online in advance. I called several times prior to our trip to assure it was okay that a seperate credit card holder reserved the room, and we paid with a deperate one.\n\nI had guests arriving from all over, some drove 10+ hours and when they arrived, were not able to check in. They were refused to it being under a different name, even though I confirmed this was okay prior to arriving. They needed the confirmation number, but the one THEY SENT ME (email proof) was not working. I called the front desk while still en route to Nashville to let them know guests were waiting, and BOTH women were extremely rude and condescending. My guests had to wait an hour before getting a room.\n\nWe arrived at 4pm and had a tight schedule as we had activites starting at 5:30. We were supposed to go in, decorate for the celebration, get ready and leave. This was not the case. Upon checking in, I am told that they preauthorize the card AT CHECKIN, even though I confirmed several times over the phone that the card was just to reserve the room and we could pay at check out with our choice of payment. We had girls from all over the country coming that were bringing money towards the room, and it was to be deposited before checkout. We did not have time to go to the bank before our paid for, scheduled activities and the only offer they gave us was to preauthorize half of the amount one night until we get the rest tomorrow. At this point we are already late and not ready for our outing due to their poor communication, and it ruined our other experiences as well.\n\nThe fun doesnt stop there....we paid for a junior sweet with a sofa and a chair, two beds, and paid extra for a pull out bed. Upon FINALLY getting into our room, there is no extra bed, and not a sofa, but two chairs. This was crucial to our sleeping arrangments, and was all requeated and confirmed prior to arrival. We also requested it when they gave us a room key, and now its 12 oclock at night and we have one pull out sofa and they are still giving us a hard time about the sofa. If we could, wed pack and leave immediately but this is a once in a life time thing for my best friend, so were stuck here.

Usually those with said hair know exactly who that is, which means there is always a wait for this barber. There are very few things I hate waiting on more than a haircut, so I usually avoid these places. Today however was my lucky day.

Went to the Gaylord Opryland Resort while we were in Nashville. Did not stay there but came to visit the grounds and take the tour of the resort. After looking at the rates for the evening, the rates were very similar to those where we were staying. That does NOT mean you would get one of the rooms with the balcony overlooking the waterfalls, river and beautiful gardens. If you got one of those rooms for the price that was being advertised, it would be a great deal. \n\nFirst off, we parked in the parking lot next to the hotel. At a rate of $38 + tax [about $42 total] it was pretty expensive. We got to park right up against the hotel then realized that there is a free parking lot with a shuttle; ouch! The resort is completely enclosed so it is always 68 to 72 degrees inside. We took the river boat tour that is very informative and a nice couple of minutes to take a tour around the resort. Its about $12 and though we had to wait about an hour for it to be repaired, it allowed us to go to the island for a little shopping. By \"us\", of course I mean my wife and daughter. \n\nA very neat fact is that they sent empty bottles all over the world and asked them to send it back with local water.  Bottles came back from Europe, Africa, South American and other. I hope there was no disease in the Nile waters, uh no. So they take all the bottles and pour it into this man made river in a special ceremony. Who knows, there could be water from Chapala, Guadalajara; my Dad's  home town. Again, uh no.\n\nThe riverboat was fun and the very knowledgeable tour guide gave us some great info. We went to see some of the shops and unfortunately some of the shops were not open, such as the ice cream shop or cafe in the middle of the resort. \n\nIf we would have known about the free parking, this would have been a very inexpensive outing and a nice get away from the summer heat. I still think it was a great time to visit and enjoy the environment.", "date": "2016-09-19 05:14:10"}

When she did not like the daiquiri because it was too sweet, he replied \"well, it's a daiquiri\". \n\nThen, trying still to be nice, even though he was raising his nose at my wife, I said \"Do you have anything like a martini for pregnant women?\" And he said, \"I mean, we have juice...\"\n\nI'm alright with the fact that Mr. B's hasn't jumped on the wave of hip restaurants that  understand that when you are pregnant, you'd still like to have unique cocktail option (who the hell is still serving daiquiris?), but the dude was just an ass about it.  It's not often I spend 250 dollars on a meal and get insulted.    \n\n He was generally short and put off by us the entire night (every 15 minutes when he would happen to come over to our table... we had reservations at 5:30, he didn't take our order until 6:45).  \n\nAnyway, I hear there is good brunch at Mr. B's, but I don't think we will be going back.  There are too many great restaurants (We went to Coquette for dinner the next night, and it was amazing, and the service was excellent)  in New Orleans, and this place is top level price for mediocre food.", "date": "2014-11-30 19:12:53"}

With the sound of the incoming waves slapping against the pilings beneath us, it was the ideal setting for what was a flawless meal. It was late in the day and, having skipped lunch in favor of extensive sightseeing, we were ravenous, so we started with a bowl of creamy and delicately seasoned lobster bisque and a richly dense New England style clam chowder. We followed this by sharing a pound of steamed mussels, served in a white wine and garlic broth, every last drop of which was absorbed by crusty French Bread, and then splitting an order of calamari, sauteed in butter, garlic, white wine, and sun-dried tomatoes and served on a bed of linguini. Including tax and tip, we stuffed ourselves for only $17.00 each! The very nautical decor and bustling open-air kitchen add to your dining enjoyment. There's a long bar (where food is also served) that seats a couple of dozen, and a massive aquarium - with water pumped up from the ocean below - houses lobsters and crabs just brought in from the surrounding waters.

Apparently they don't serve soup through the summer (a bit of a bummer since I am a year round soup junkie), but their selection is fairly diverse for such a small cafe.\n\nEdgehill Studios Cafe has more room than I expected, and it typically isn't too busy, so it's an alright spot to duck in and do some web surfing.  The staff is quick and friendly, and it's usually pretty quiet.  I haven't visited the actual studio or been on an evening with live music, but I imagine it is pretty par for a coffee shop/venue.  I deem Edgehill Cafe worthy of your business, but I just can't quite make it a regular stop.  I'll stick to Portland Brew.", "date": "2008-05-01 21:00:48"}

One guy ordered shrimp and grits, I ordered the diver sea scallop app, and the others all ordered barbecue shrimp. My scallops practically melted off my fork. Devine! We all got a spoonful of grits which were beyond fab. And I ate at least 1/3 of my neighbor's shrimp. We had to get extra bread to sop up the goodness left over.

It felt very homemade, which to some ppl is a good quality. However, when I go out and pay for my food, I like ordering things that I dont normally encounter in an every day kitchen or something that I can't make myself! The fries were really good though. thin, crispy, and hot right when they come out.\n\nMy friend took a risk from her usual order of the Sonora and ordered the Baltimore BLT. She said the Baltimore BLT was good (crab cakes yall) but the Sonora is still her fav (cajun seasoned shrimp with guac and pico de gallo). Another friend ordered the Tuna Salad which looked good! (Gonna order the salmon salad next time) he said it was great. Unlimited soft drinks refills if you order your stuff and pretty good (artsy grundgy) lookin dude servers. \n\nOverall an ok experience. but excellent service! Around $11 total plus tax and tip for my meal. Meh. A little more than I would've like to spend for lunch but this was fine. It was a great day out so we sat out on the porch and people watched. Bring your sunglasses when you come here in case it becomes a good day and you can sit out and do the same!

Stunning view is an understatement. Every square inch is covered in indoor lush tropical gardens, rivers, ponds with koi, and several waterfalls. Being the incredible size it is, you must carry a map or stop at their map stations to figure out where you are. Every where you turn, is an incredible photo opportunity. This a place of intriguing explorations of multilevel curiosities. It takes a small village to keep this resort running. Truly the Disney world for adults. Staff is trained to smile and offer warm hellos as you walk by, offer professional prompt service, and jump to their feet if you say \"boo\". I don't know how the staff does it. I wouldn't be able to do it. I don't know able you, but I don't clean toilets with a peppy smile. Perhaps supergluing their faces with a permanent smile and a secret record button they press when you walk by. There are many many different bars and restaurants to choose from. Anywhere from fun casual to trendy to fine dining. The banquet food offered everyday was a hit or miss. The quality was there, especially for banquet food, but it mostly depended on your personal taste preference. We visited 2 restaurants and even room service. Each was very good and service was on par. Downside is that everything is extremely expensive. A dollar store type of cheap tre semme travel pump hairspray was almost $7. So don't forget your hairspray or deodorant people. I was already expecting inflated prices in the stores and bar because of the location, however, we almost peed our pants when we got our drink bill. $67 for 4 cheap bicardi and cokes. I'm scared what the bill would have been had we ordered a high end liquor. So back to the convention for the free drinks we went. I visited the spa. 20% gratuity was included in the bill. Which is ok. I would have tipped 18-20% anyways. The anti aging facial was more expensive than most spas, but I'd have to admit, it was worth it even tho I broke out in some kind of rash under my lower lip. I swear I'm not allergic to any products I've used before! Oh well. Nobody's fault. I would still go back. My skin felt radiant afterwards. \n\nThe downside is that the resort is nowhere near downtown Nashville. The entire inside of the resort is a giant greenhouse for their incredible species of plants. So expect it to be very warm and humid. Expect to dish out a lot of money on food and drinks. I was not able to stay over the weekend, but I would have liked to seen a bit more entertainment walking the miles and miles of tropical paths. It would truly be comparable to a Disney resort, with no reason to leave, for adults if they had some kind of entertainers. They definitely have the room and atmosphere to accommodate some nightly entertainment. Perhaps some live music in one of their wonderful gazebos? Actors in costume greeting guests? \n\nSo after my ridiculous blabbing, I would say that the staff is unbelievably amazing, there is no reason to leave the resort if you are staying only a few days (unless you are seeking entertainment) I don't recommend this for children. They would definitely be bored.", "date": "2017-05-26 21:42:13"}

We tried St. James three times and the food was fine, but the servers had such attitude and lack of knowledge of how to care for patrons.

Ordered a cocktail. A simple old fashioned with brandy. I asked for soco and they didn't have it. So i asked for brandy. Cocktail was good. Get the bill later ... $12 cocktail. For real! It wasn't even an 8oz cocktail. More like a 4oz! And there was a $4 bogus charge on there which i was unaware about when ordering and that long bearded guy again behind the bar told me what it was for after the fact (something to do with adding a higher liquor quantity). I wouldn't have wanted that in the first place!! So again, no forgiveness and forced to pay that bill. Again, zero tip. \n\notherwise, you can get takeout beer here and the outdoor couches are ok.

However, when I checked in, they charged me for both nights because the $300 I had already deposited had not \"appeared on the system.\" They finally found the glitch and said they'd give the money back at checkout (which they have yet to do), and $300 is some good spending money, especially at this resort. \nWhen it came to checkout, they apply a $18/night resort fee, so...WHY is this NOT applied to the room rate in the first place?!? So if you're looking at prices, add that, plus parking ($20 self park, $28 valet A NIGHT!). Then add the additional SIX taxes per night, that average around $15 per tax. You do the math, and add that to the room rate that is advertised before deciding on an extended stay.

Lots of fancy LED lighting and a bit of tacky fish oriented decorations too, but, it's nice and comfortable and contemporary.  Even the music playing over the loud speaker was downtempo, providing a \"big city\" feel to the establishment.\n\nWe were greeted instantly, and seated in the dining area, being that we were here for sushi and not hibachi. All the hibachi tables were being used though, either by groups or couples.  They also have a larger hibachi in a private area for large groups.\n\nMy friend had some spicy rolls and really enjoyed them. The presentation was clean and crisp. I had some sashimi and the fish was fresh, generous and delicious. I went to Sakura two days later alone, and the nigiri tasted fishy, when the salmon I had at Tomo was fresh and sweet, as salmon should be. \n\nI also had the shrimp tempura appetizer which featured two very large prawns (biggest I've had in the city!) and a nice mix of veggies. They were tasty as well. \n\nThe service was a bit slow, but, needs were met when requests were made.

It is not just a tourist trap, even though you can find it at the end of the SB pier past all the other tourists traps. Love to get the rock crab deal ($25 for a 2-3lb rock crab with onion rings) \n\nMy favorite moment:\n\nI will never forget the day we tried their California King crab for the first time. It was a weekend when all my girls came back to town and we had gone kayaking/ S.U.P. (With paddle sports from the Harbor area) and we had made plans to grab an early dinner from the shellfish co. While on the water we saw them pulling up fresh cali kings from the side of the pier. After our hour on the ocean, we were famished but still aware that it could be a wait since the place is small and popular. Luckily since it was early (before 5pm dinner rush) we were seated quickly. The server recommended the cali kings, said we wouldnt regret it because they were really fresh. We looked over and there they were! Being dumped into the tanks. They were kicking and trying to climb out. \n\nPriced at $17.95 per lb, they came anywhere between 1.5 to 3 lbs. I went for a 2pounder. That first succulent bite was heaven. And I mean, damn that is one buttery heaven. Each morsel was so large, so sweet..all of my girls and I were silent, with glistening eyeballs staring at each other. \n\nAfter that day, I couldn't get that crab out of my mind. Any chance I could I wanted to go back before the season was over.\n\nBut be careful, a 3 pounder means you're eating a $75 crab. Only negative is that you can only choose between soup or salad. For that price..I should've gotten both. It's okay, just add a $1 and you can both i guess. \n\nBesides the crab, the oysters are always good and I highly recommend the uni appetizer. \n\nOkay I really recommend the uni appetizer. I usually buy my own uni fresh and shuck it at home, but these they place on top of a fresh scallop on top of a lime pinwheel with a side of ponzu. It's so fresh and clean, that they leave the empty uni shell as a center piece with its spines still wiggling.", "date": "2017-04-20 04:19:46"}

We were lucky that we went there way past the lunch rush and so it was easy to get a table. And the food, oh my! As a vegetarian, I was resigned to eating a salad. I started out with eggplant sticks, which were not bad. To be fair, the waitress offered a veggie linguini and I was not sure if I wanted to order that because I try to avoid pasta/wheat even though I don't have celiac. But my son ordered fettucine with veal and one look at the fettucine, I wanted the pasta! He absolutely loved the veal. My pasta was oh so fabulous. It was tossed in lemon butter sauce and the vegetables were plenty. \n\nMy partner ordered the BBQ shrimp and he thinks it is his best meal on this entire trip over the past two weeks. Order the shrimp. What else is there to say? The sauce it was served on was delicious, buttery and nicely spiced. It is not at all what you think when you think of barbecue. \n\nThe only disappointment was the bread pudding. Perhaps we were too full to appreciate it. Perhaps another favorite bread pudding from  a different restaurant spoiled us. It was just okay.  Overall, a fantastic meal and a fantastic place.", "date": "2015-12-22 06:11:27"}

Never had a bad drink, they are light and refreshing and strong! My boyfriend and I ordered the pulled pork empanadas and I ordered the mushroom salad. The 2 medium sized empanadas came out hot and filled with tender perfectly cooked pork. The pork wasn't covered with seasoning or sauce which was great because it let the natural pork flavor shine, if they don't have the cover with other flavors you know it's good! The mushroom salad was light but filling (if that makes sense) looked small but once I mixed it all together it was a good sized salad. The tart and tangy dressing was a perfect mix with the creamy goat cheese and the crystallized ginger gave it a little sweetness. The mushrooms were the perfect topping and blended right in.

Living in the Midwest and missing the ocean, we were craving seafood.  I used my Yelp app on my phone to find this spot.  The location is great -- at the end of a pier overlooking the Pacific.  The atmosphere is very casual and family-friendly and parking is easy and can be validated.  My main disappointment with this place is that although all the fish and seafood was definitely fresh, the majority of it was flown in from other locales (mostly Atlantic Ocean).  It just seemed so silly to eat seafood flown in while sitting next to the ocean.  I had the crab sandwich (not local crab) and it was really delicious.  My husband had the lobster (from Maine) tacos and was disappointed.  I tasted it as well and found that they weren't terrible but all the seasoning and additions really took away from the great taste of lobster.  Service was good, beers were good, and the location is great, so while I think this place is a solid 3.5 stars, I will bump it up to 4.  Can't beat oceanfront dining!", "date": "2012-01-03 17:10:36"}

I was very excited when my husband agreed on the Cake Boutique to make our cake for her 5th this year. I wanted a nice five layer cake and no expense was to be spared! I cannot even begin to tell you how shocked I was at their terrible customer service. The lady showed me the different cakes and informed me on how much each one was. I told her I liked the three tier cake but might need something bigger since I specifically wanted five layers. She told me the basic starting price and let me know decorations would cost more. I was fine with that and told her I would like to get the order started. When I asked her if I could taste a few flavors she said they don't let people taste for free but I could buy some cupcakes if I wanted to. When I asked if the cupcakes in the case were all the flavors they made, she just shrugged her shoulders and said \"I think so.\" So I bought a chocolate, yellow and raspberry filled cupcake. I sat at the table to taste them ( I noticed after I sat down there was a sign on the table that said \"reserved for cake tasting\" ) I then asked her if there was delivery available, since I did not want to risk driving with the cake myself and possibly ruining it. She said for an additional $50 I could get it delivered. I told her my major cross streets and she said she was going to check on something and would be right back. While she was gone I tasted the cupcakes and I could not believe how dry and bland they were. I was really shocked, the raspberry filled one was a little better tasting but not by much. I really cannot tell you what specific flavor they were because she didn't tell me. So as I waited for her I decided not to use them. I can put up with bad customer service if the product is at least amazing but after I sampled it there was no way I was going to pay $600 for a cake and get treated the way I did and have it taste horrible on top of all that. So just because they have a fancy store and nice displays- don't just assume that the service is great and the product is good. I will stick with Nadine's- they have outstanding customer service and the cakes never let me down.", "date": "2013-07-13 07:15:21"}

(most other alternatives serve greasy, overly saucey Chinese food)\n\nShanghai Station's entrance is down a flight of stairs and the restaurant itself is situated under a hairdresser / subway. Nara used to be there, known for their sake bombs and drunken college nights (or so I've heard); Shanghai Station seems to want to keep up the drinking part of it, heavily advertising their drink specials and with a darkish interior decor interspersed with disco-y lights. Wasn't expecting too much of the food, especially since they seem to be, as a restaurant, more focused on their alcohol selection, but I was so pleasantly surprised with their food.\n\nTo preface my later comments about service of the restaurant and for context: we came in a huge group of 20 people. We ordered the pork soup dumplings (\u5c0f\u7c60\u5305), the crab meat soup dumplings, Dan Dan noodles, Chinese broccoli, broccoli with beef, shrimp fried rice, scallion pancakes and crystal shrimp. \n\nHighlights: \nPork soup dumplings - they were absolutely delicious! Each order comes with 6 dumplings, and it came out steaming hot. My usual pet peeve with these kinds of dumplings (and I'm pretty picky with them because I was spoiled with good food in Hong Kong) is when they have super thick dumpling skins. It was not the case with these - the wrappers were delicate and thin, holding the hot, rich soup that spurts out when you bite into them. Would highly recommend! My only complaint would be that they didn't bring out the vinegar dipping sauce with this dish, but make sure you ask for it because a soup dumpling would not be complete without a dash of vinegar and thin ginger strands.\n\nCrab soup dumplings - basically same as above, but with a distinct crab flavor. \n\nDan Dan noodles - they used a softer type of noodle to make this dish compared to the usual type, and I have mixed feelings about it. Taste was solid though, but I'd suggest going to the Sichuan restaurants if you really crave the authentic type of Dan Dan noodles.\n\nChinese broccoli - this type of vegetable (\u82a5\u862d) is probably one of my favorite types of vegetables, and it bears little resemblance to broccoli, so the name might be confusing. It's lightly saut\u00e9ed in garlic, nothing too fancy but really good. Serving size is a little small though! \n\nService - the soup dumplings came out pretty quickly, but we waited a long long time for the other dishes. We were in a huge group and they just opened, so I wouldn't hold it against them too much. Throughout the meal the servers were also pretty good at refilling water during the wait. \n\nAll in all, a good, affordable option for some good Chinese food! Definitely get the soup dumplings, the crystal shrimp / broccoli with beef were alright but I'd recommend trying other dishes since they have a pretty expansive menu!", "date": "2016-03-31 19:42:20"}

The guacamole could have used some more seasoning and the thick-cut bacon was okay. \n\nThe fries that came with the burger were salty and soggy; my husband commented that they were likely old. There was a good amount of other customers in the restaurant , so I'm not really sure why there would be old fries unless they cooked huge batches of them in advance (maybe to keep up with their promise of \"endless french fried potatoes\"?). The sweet potato chips we had as an app were fresh and also a favorite with my family, so I'd suggest getting the chips instead of the fries. \n\nFrom the prices on the menu (around $9 for burgers), you'd think that the food would be good or at least a notch higher than \"decent\".

Again, well prepared, but lacked a bit of seasoning. The American in me added salt and pepper, but I think it needed something else. Filling and healthy nonetheless. On another visit I would order something else. I did really enjoyed the shrimp roll that came along with the combo. I believe it was like a fried rice roll. I wasn't crazy about the egg roll. \n\nThe hot ginger tea was very nice and soothing for a cool Santa Barbara evening. It was a bit chilly, so upon request our waiter turned on the outdoor heaters for us which was nice touch. Everyone in my party seemed to enjoy their meals. Even though I wasn't wowed, I'd come here again...but I'm snagging a hut and ordering something else.", "date": "2014-05-25 22:17:57"}

There was a live band but it wasn't quite jazzy and the music was drowned out by the loud conversations. The food was delicious though and the staff was attentive.\n\n+ Seafood Gumbo: you could treat this soup dish as an entree since the portion size is a full bowl and it comes with rice. Lots of seafood but beware of the cracked shell pieces you may have to fish out. The gumbo was pretty good; it has a bit of a kick and was an overall very hearty soup dish. \n\n+ Soft Shell Crab: I almost cancelled this order when I saw the size of my seafood gumbo but since the waitress highly recommended it, I thought I would power through lunch and then follow that up with a power nap! :) The soft shell crab was my favorite at Mr. B's Bistro. The crab was nice and crunchy on the outside, seasoning was just right as you can still taste the crab meat. Tender pieces of crab.. I was so full from the gumbo but I just couldn't stop eating the soft shell crab!\n\n+ Shrimp & Grits: The bacon wrapped gulf shrimp was delicious. I was so tempted to order this dish but just had shrimp & grits the night before. Creamy grits with good sized shrimp.. and that bacon made it even better! Perhaps a mention of bacon should be included in the name of the dish rather than just in the description. Yes, knowing there's bacon would make the dish sell better.. at least that's the conclusion our lunch party agreed on.\n\n+ Bob's Coffee: similar to Kahlua. I found it a bit too sweet for my taste. \n\nThe seating setup was a bit odd, for a party of 5 there were 4 chairs and the head of the table sat on a booth seat. Not too much room in between the tables. In case you're looking for the restrooms, head to the bar and go downstairs.", "date": "2015-05-27 01:50:12"}

I made a reservation for 4 people last Saturday. Kuzina, as with many popular restaurants, is much easier to get in to without a wait in the Summer. Kuzina is in a strip mill on route 70, there are two other popular restaurants in the same strip mall, the Dolsot House and Han Dynasty.\n\nKuzina is simple and clean inside with soft colors, some tasteful paintings and nice lighting. I really like Greek and Mediterranean cuisines and Kuzina has a good size menu and selection. I have also been here a couple of times for lunch and they do have lunch special menu.\n\nI have tried several different dishes and the food has always been good to very good. On this night I chose the Lamb Gyro Shawarma Platter that comes served with tahini sauce, house side Greek Salad, french fries and pita bread. The lamb was cooked well and the pita bread was excellent. The dish has some some great flavors. We also shared the grilled octopus that was done nicely too.\n\nThe only thing keeping me being a real fan of Kuzina is sometimes the service is spotty and the balklava and desserts are just OK at best. On this evening we ordered coffee and dessert. This took at least 10 minutes to arrive after we placed the order and our coffee was served on the cold side. The restaurant was only a little more then one half full. We ordered some sort of Greek cake that was dense and dry. I can't remember the name.\n\nI do enjoy Kuzina but I just can't give it 4 stars yet, so 3.75 yelp stars, and very close to being a fan. If looking for Greek food, Kuzina is certainly worth a visit and I will come back as  a repeat customer. They do a pretty steady business also, so better to play it safe and make a reservation.", "date": "2016-07-26 16:48:05"}

The difference this time around was that I had my kids, so I wanted to find a place that they felt comfortable in (see Grand Isle). We stayed at the Westin near the river this time around, so I decided to ask the concierge about some places close by. She told me about an Italian Creole Place on Decatur and also about Olivier's. So we treked from the hotel on foot and ran into O's first (right across the street from the House of Blues. We met one of the owners who was \"barking up\" business outside and he was a consumate gentleman. We looked at the menu and while there wasnt any kid centric dishes, he assured me that they could accomodate a special order.\n\nHave you ever sat down at a place and it took more than a few minutes to get waited on, so you think its an omen for a bad experience and you know you should leave? If I had been by myself or with other adults, I would have encouraged it. My kids get a tad embarassed when dad is a hard ass (never rude mind you), so we decided to stay. Unfortunately, it was the wrong choice. With so many great restaurants in this town, you just hate to suffer through a mediocre experience. Let me summarize. Waiter was smarmy, unattentive and ill trained. Who ever taught you that it was ok to go around the table stacking dishes when picking them up. Ugh. The rabbit was flavorless as was the \"oyster dressing\" ($18.95), shrimp scampi was nothing more than grilled ($16.95) and even the open food pasta with fettucine and chicken was overun with vegetables, etc. Wine (good bottle selection) by the glass was ok but smallish and the dessert at $7.95 was certainly not prepared onsite and was average.

After using up the French bread slices that came with the plate I took some from my wife to continue sopping up the sauce.  It wasn't diet food and I didn't care.\n\nMy wife had a plate of the truffle, cheese, garlicky fries and loved them.  We did not have a reservation but were able to eat at the bar, where we got attentive and friendly service from their excellent bartenders.  I will go back, but I'm afraid that all I will ever want are those shrimps.", "date": "2011-07-30 19:59:50"}

This place gets my seal of approval.  \n\nMomo's is the equivalent of greek tapas, which means that some of the more popular traditional dishes won't exist here.  But in Greece they are called mezes, also meaning small plates and basically served the same way Spanish tapas are.  And to be honest, I think the Greeks had them well before the Spanish, so it isn't a \"everyone is doing tapas\" now thing, it is actually fairly traditional to several European/Mediterranean cultures, so keep your pants on people...\n\nFood: I really like the mezes here. I like to start off with a spread, and after trying the Melitzanosalata last time we were in I am going to recommend it!  Although, I feel that we never get enough pita when we are here, so ask for more early. Service review comes later.  And also a cheese plate.  I prefer the baked feta, but last time we got the brie, which was also really good, though it is covered with sweetness (fruits and a sweet sauce) so I am going to leave it for my \"dessert\" choice next time, GREAT way to finish a meal.  You can also get your fill of spanikopita, saganaki, dolmades, and other greek staples that you may not be so familiar with like the Grilled Lokaneko Sausage.  So good.  I was part of a plan to try to make these sausages once, and after a successful batch I have decided it is really just easier for me to go find a good one someone else made...\n\nNot a fan of or just not in the mood for mezes?  You can also get your hands on a good gyro.  Not the best gyro in town, for that you would have needed to head back down Delmar to the Gyro House with cash in hand - but I am not sure of the status of this place, well that's another review... In the mean time, swing in here for a decent piece of gyro.\n\nService: Ok, this is super spotty.  Sometimes I go in and I get awesome service, quick seating,  easy ordering, great drinks (I like the Sangria, I know, not Greek, but the make it so good). Other times, like this past time, I decide to order all of my mezes at once because I worry I will absolutely never see my waiter again.  And I consider running out on the check because after I haven't seen him since he set down the food I wonder if he was killed by a belly dancer.  Ok Momos, I have never run out on a check here, but really get it together.  We seem to have great service sitting inside and poorer service sitting outside. Isn't the patio the coveted spot? I just want to see my waiter more than three times during a meal: drinks, order, food drop off.... yeah you should at least see him one more time for the check!  It can be a bit of a catastrophe.\n\nAtmosphere:  Not gonna lie folks, the belly dancers freak me out.  I prefer to go on non-dancing nights (aka Sunday) and before they get into full swing.  It is entertaining at first, then it gets creepy.  Some people love it, like all the tipsy 40 and 50 year old guys, and actually some of the ladies night out crowds too... this is beyond my comprehension.  But if this is your thing, get in there.  I am fairly sure these girls are good at what they are doing, some are obviously better than others, but they can shake it (which is why I think the outdoor service is bad, they only dance inside).  Also the decor is cool.  Nothing to write home about, but it feels like a Greek place to me with warm bold colors and lanterns.\n\nOverall: I am going back.  It is right by my house, it is a great little spot, and I like the meatballs (I don't think I mentioned that before).  The food is great! The service sometimes sucks, but you cant get it all all of the time.  So try it out! and ask for extra pita.", "date": "2010-10-06 15:06:29"}

It was Labor Day.  This was a double whammy when trying to find an open restaurant.  Then MM popped into my head.  I was sure they'd be open...and they were!\n\nWe went to the location on Oak Street.  I really liked the vibe of the place.  Kind of cool funky.  There were 2 floors of seating, and also a balcony for dining outside.   Unfortunately we were unable to eat outside, as it had been raining off and on.  \n\nThe service was top notch.  Everyone we came in contact with was very nice and beers were refilled quickly...which is always a good thing.\n\nNow for the food...\n\nI ordered a Caesar salad.  It was fantastic!  Good lettuce to dressing ratio.  Delicious, fresh croutons.  And shavings of parmesan cheese.  I'm also pretty sure that the dressing contained anchovy paste, and this is as it should be!  YUM! \n\nEveryone that mentions MM to me, says that the Holy Shitake pizza is the best.  I'm a mushroom luvuh, so I took their advice and went with that.  I added bacon to it.  First off, I wanted some meat on my pizza, and secondly...well...bacon makes everything better.  And it's drizzled with a garlic aioli!  Can't go wrong with that.\n\nO.M.G!  This pizza was amazing!  The flavors all went well together and the crust was delicious as well.  \n\nWe also tried the Thai pizza. It was good, but not great. The veggies on the pizza could've been cooked a little more, and overall I expected it to have more of a curry taste.  It also had a sweetness to it.  Too sweet for my taste.  It just didn't seem \"Thai\" at all to me.\n\nI would absolutely go back to Mellow Mushroom.  I will always get the Caesar salad, and I'll always get the mushroom pizza.  Each time I go, I'll also try a different one.  But I have a feeling the Holy Shitake will always remain my favorite.   \n\nI do have to note though...even though I LOVED the Holy Shitake pizza, if I were really in the mood for pizza, it wouldn't satisfy my craving.

I could not have been more pleasantly surprised! There are a couple of different dining rooms - one with more of a bistro / fine dining setting, and the other - where we sat - more of a low-key lounge with kooky lighting and leopard-topped couches. The furniture could definitely use a bit of an update, but the music was very modern and relaxing - think Ingrid Michaelson meets Air. The star dishes here were definitely the escargots appetizer - in the most delectable savory mushroom sauce - the salmon entree (wrapped in phyllo dough and served with a cauliflower mouse, and a scrumptious morsel of ratatouille inside a sweetly carved zucchini), and the profiteroles for dessert -- made with the fluffiest pastry, and the perfect balance of sweet dripping chocolate and thick milky ice cream. The staff was very friendly knowledgeable about the wine, the menu, and the history of the building - and big points have to go to our server, Jason, who made excellent recommendations. This is definitely a great little hidden gem for a dinner with friends or a date with a loved one. I'll definitely be going back.", "date": "2012-10-10 02:06:12"}

SOOO glad we picked this place!\n\nSanta Barbara is known for their super fresh seafood, so we were delighted to find that there was the perfect spot, at the end of the pier.  We came at around 11:30am, which was perfect, because we beat the big lunch rush.  We were seated within 15 minutes, so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited.  You're also able to order up at the window and eat at one of the picnic tables they have set up on the pier if you don't feel like waiting. \n\nWe were seated outside, so we were literally eating a few yards from the edge of the pier.  It was beautiful.  \n\nThe four of us shared a pitcher of Hefenweizen, which paired deliciously with all of the food to come.  Light, refreshing, and the view was a big plus.  And the whole pitcher was only $18!\n\nWe started off with an appetizer and shared a dozen of the Morrow Bay Oysters and Kusshi Oysters.  The Morrow Bays were bigger than the Kusshi, so I expected a saltier, less sweet taste.  It was actually just as sweet and the smaller, Kusshi Oysters.  I was pleasantly surprised, and these were both very fresh!  \n\nFor my main course, I ordered the half MAINE LOBSTER, which also came with Onion Rings and a soup-- I went with the LOBSTER BISQUE.  The half Maine Lobster was super fresh and tender.  The tail was a little chewy, but better than a lot of lobsters I've had lately.  My favorite part was the super meaty claw!  It came out of the shell beautifully with ease, and melted like butter in my mouth.  I didn't even need the side of melted butter!  This dish was simple and sweet.  The Lobster Bisque was good, but nothing I'd be craving.  I hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it, but I think they just used lobster for the flavor.  Oh!  The Onion Rings here are amazing.  Light, crisp, and flakey!\n\nMy friends ordered the Lobster Roll and the Rock Crab Claws (the rounder shaped claws with the black tips).  The Lobster Roll looked amazing, and it wasn't super drenched in mayo either.  I noticed that my friend didn't eat the roll-- it looked pretty basic/grocery store bought.  It would be nice if they used a buttery, toasted, baguette, as I've seen in other restaurants.  The Rock Crab Claws were fresh and meaty, I must order this one next time.  \n\nOverall, we loved the food and ambiance here-- a perfect ending to our trip! :)", "date": "2015-03-18 17:59:39"}

Just as the other reviewers pointed out, this Disneyland for adults makes me feel trapped inside an oversized, overpriced, pretentious playground.  What bothers me is that the staff at the various restaurants and cafes all look unhappy -- nary a smile was present -- which, to me, is not a good sign for I prefer to patronize businesses where the employees are happy.   The whole outfit seem very very commercial to me, lacking a certain warmth.  In retrospect, I notice all the talk about how grand the Opryland is seems to be because the corporation that owns it touts its own horn real well!\n\nWhile we were there, a huge sales convention for the Avaya folks were taking place and they filled all the restaurants and made the place seem too business-y for a vacation.  All the tables at the Irish pub and the sports bar was filled.   The Avaya organizers also blocked off some parts of the resort near the convention center, most importantly walkways that connect certain areas, and forced us to take long detours that were at least 5 minutes to walk around.  I really resent that.\n\nWe booked a greenhouse atrium view room, and got the Delta area.  Wish we got the Nature Conservatory  area instead -- because it is a nicer, lusher, older (hence more mature) greenhouse.  Our room look out to the spectacular greenhouse structure, but the commercialism of the hotel was too visible from the balcony. Stax, the stage for concert of the convention center, and two other cafes were visible.  I would prefer less commercialism in my face for the price I paid.  Still, the open air balcony with two quaint chair and a metal table was cute.  \n\nBeware that the sound of the various waterfalls can be really loud in the greenhouse from your room.  You may like the sound of water in the background.  I didn't mind it, though it sounded more like white noise than a pleasant burble.  \n\nOverall, I detest the commercialism present at every turn of this hotel, (the self-guided audio tour of the greenhouse costs $5! shuttle to downtown: $15!), dislike the distance I have to go to get to the car, and the large business crowd thronging the resort.   \n\nThe bed was ok, the coffee maker, which I used to boil water, was disgusting -- the water came out with an oily film.  Wif speed was ok (though it costs $15 per day as part of the mandatory resort fee).  Only ate at the Irish pub after reading Yelp reviews that said it is the best of the bunch.  The fish and chip was decent, but I found the french fries and onion rings taste a bit burn.\n\nI am happy to experience a slice of Nashville critical to its culture, though quite disappointed.\n\nCome here for the experience if you like, but also try other good hotels in Nashville!", "date": "2009-10-16 00:03:34"}

I'll admit I was a little apprehensive going in the first time, but it was really good every time we went back and we make sure to stop in whenever we're in Tucson.\n\nTonight, we were craving Indian food and wanted to get out of the Phoenix area for a while. This was the obvious choice. My wife had her usual chicken tikka masala and mango lasse. I had the shrimp masala. We also shared the keema samosas appetizer, made better by the tamarind sauce, some kashmiri rice with some naan. The masala wasn't as spicy as I was expecting when I ordered it at a medium spice, but I'd rather have it be not hot enough than too hot. The masala mixed with the kashmiri rice piled on the naan is like an explosion of flavor that I can't get enough of. \n\nThe atmosphere isn't too Americanized, nor is it cheesy over-the-top Indian - it's just right. The music that they pipe in isn't too loud, and it's really enjoyable. The service is always quick and friendly. The restaurant itself is smaller, but instead of feeling like a sardine in a tin can, it feels cozy. This is one of the few places my wife and I are willing to drive 2 hours just to have dinner at. \n\nIf you've never had Indian food and haven't wanted to try it because you've heard it's really spicy, give this place a try (they'll make it as spicy as you like it, even if it's not spicy at all like my wife likes it).

When you walk in you cant help but notice the variety of sizes of fresh crabs and lobsters in the large aquarium tanks to your left with a guy behind the glass counter chopping and steaming them. I always order the spider crab special which starts off with a cup of clam chowder; absolutely the best Ive had thus far. They also serve a few shrimp dishes along with different lobster dishes as well, apparently lobster is available about 6 of my 10 visits. Overall you can try alot of different fresh shellfish without paying as much as you will other places offereing the same items in their menu. Now that I write about it ... I think Im going to go today ..", "date": "2007-06-03 16:46:16"}

Upon entering Siam Elephant for the first time, I really wanted the food to be good!  The service was exceptionally great, and accommodating .  (Note: I love good food of any kind, but I am also a bit \"picky\"). When I ordered the lunch special I politely said I did not want the egg roll and wonton , as they were fried.  The waitress quickly responded that they would substitute a fresh spring roll - first time I've ever had that happen!    \n\nFirst trip to any THAI restaurant , I order red curry to compare \"apples to apples\" . Again the waitress accommodated my request for extra vegetables but no bell pepper and baby corn.  ( I am a nice person , but often a waitress' worst nightmare )\n\nOn to the food - spring roll ( substitution) was nicely done with a sweet sauce with crushed peanuts and shredded carrot.  Lunch special soup was Tom Yum and was incredibly salty. I couldn't eat more than two bites. And personal preference for me, I like my mushrooms cooked- the ones in the soup were sliced and dropped in the hot broth so they were more raw than cooked.  This had nothing to do with the soup, just be aware for personal preference.  Red Curry came , medium spicy and was spot on for spiciness.  But the curry itself had NO flavor.  There was a nice assortment of vegetables, and the chicken had that weird texture - like it was boiled rather than saut\u00e9ed .  Took a bit of curry sauce alone without rice and it was simply bland .   And for all the times I complained about \" too strong\" Thai ice tea , this was again, bland .  I felt I wasted all those calories on a drink with no flavor !  On a positive note, I Had the brown rice instead of white rice and THIS IS THE FIRST THAI RESTAURANT THAT DOESNT CHARGE MORE FOR BROWN RICE!  \n\nThe food was disappointing overall,but the service was so good.  Overall rating was 3 stars , 1 for food and 2 for service  ( and for the brown rice upgrade at no charge) !", "date": "2015-03-18 21:40:58"}

We couldn't get a table when we arrived due to their rule about having almost all present before seating!  We had a large party of 15, with all but the birthday girl present within 15 minutes.  It was a Friday night and the Cards were playing so finding a parking space was insane! It took all of us 20-30 minutes since there isn't a parking lot or valet.  There wasn't enough seats for the 12 of us to wait for the remaining party, so there was a lot of standing involved!  When the late bday girl and remaining guests arrived, we STILL had to wait for a table!  Though the guest were over an hour late, the rest of us were there and should've been seated.  When we were finally seated at a table, I looked at my watch and turns out that I waited TWO HOURS for a chair!  If this wasn't where the bday girl wanted to eat, we would've convinced her to leave, but turning 30 is kinda important.\n\nThen there was the poor service from the waiter I'll call Bill (cuz that's what his name rhymes with).  He had an attitude all night even though he knew we were NOT in the mood for it due to the extreme waiting.  He made a snide comments about giving us straws, he made a patronizing comment about the drink special, he didn't check in on us while the others ate and drank ( I said others because I refused to eat there and give Phil the 18% group gratuity after he initial attitude with us), and had an attitude about how the restaurant doesn't split bills \"everyone else can do the math,\" and lacked apology skills when confronted by the manager.  The others didn't like the pasta they had, but did get a 25% discount from the manager to patch things us, and were urged to fill out the survey cards that go to the owner.\nI had one drink at Caleco's bar, but went to TGIFriday's for dinner afterwards.  Their service was fast and friendly!  I had my food within 20 minutes of arriving (tasty Jack Daniels chicken) .  \n\nCaleco's needs to wake up and modernize!  Had they seated the large group, more drinks and appetizers would've been ordered while we waited for the rest of the party to arrive.  Bills that can't be split is old-fashioned.  It causes tension between friends and coworkers and makes us all not like the restaurant.  It's NOT that none of us can do the math!  There's even a calculator on all cell phones, so everyone can do the basic math of a restaurant bill, but why should we when technology for this is available?", "date": "2010-10-07 21:23:20"}

Oh my what happened? It's still a great spot but something is different! We went a few days ago and everything was off! The charro beans my favorite didn't have the same flavor. The guacamole was a disappointment in comparison to the usual guacamole. It was still good but not great! And Pepsi products! Ahhhh and no tea! What happened to the aqua Fresca?? What happened? Did the cooks change? Owners? I know you got your liquor license congratulations but y'all need to get your groove back! Had to drop a star sorry until next time. \n\n\nMy new favorite Mexican restaurant! The food is fantastic. The guacamole is perfect I always have to add something not here. The tacos are perfect if you can choose! The Playeros tacos with shrimp bacon cream cheese stuffed jalape\u00f1os and more were so yummy! My niece said I don't know what's going on in my mouth but it is awesome! Lol The Pastor tacos are great with the grilled pineapple! I only wish you could have a choice of 3 different tacos as a platter since the selection is so tasty. My favorite side is definitely the charro beans! Has a great flavor and I really think they should put them on the menu as a soup! Last but not least the flan! Oh the flan save some room...it was superb. Prices are really good $15 for the 3 taco platter with two sides. Now these are not the small tortillas that are plaguing many restaurants now! These are regular sized tortillas people with premium ingredients!", "date": "2016-07-27 04:55:36"}

One of the tragedies of the human condition is imagination.  We have the capacity to dream and fantasize limitless dreams and fantasies. We conjure our imagined selves to be these powerful beings without hindrance or handicap and when we are optimists and ambitious people we pursue these dreams with fervent dedication.\n\nHowever, unfortunately because we are limited by imperfection we are unable to satisfy every desire dreamed. The Saltwater Grill undoubtedly was born out of this beautiful dream - day dreams of contending with the big boy Louisiana seafood restaurants and being THE PLACE for Riverebend folks to go when it's time for that fried seafood platter. \n\nBut it will never be this if trends continue (over priced mediocre food, a basic misunderstanding of flavor, weird service, uncomfortable ambiance - read all the other bad reviews for details). When you are growing your business, your good reviews only matter a fraction of what your bad reviews are worth. Take the note, Saltwater Grill!  Read your bad reviews and make intelligent changes!  It seems like every complaint from the bad reviews were duplicated in our experience. That seems real lazy.\n\nSometimes we must take hard, honest looks at ourselves and admit that we can't do ALL THE THINGS well.  It appears as if running a restaurant is just not something the folks at Saltwater can do well.\n\nLook- I can't skateboard.

Live blues bands add to this fun, inviting atmosphere. Guaranteed, you'll see my friends here on many many weekends to come.\n\nAs for the menu, there are still kinks to work out.

The mac and cheese was intensely rich, though a bit bland, even with the addition of chewy crawfish meat. Lamb sliders were juicy little bites, though I tasted none of the sun-dried cranberry aioli listed on the menu. The \"primal chili\" had a great balance of meat and beans, topped with a bit of melted chocolate and (too much) sea salt. \n\nService was friendly, attentive and clearly nervous.

I also don't care much for restaurants that bill themselves as \"family friendly\" and seat children in the bar area (side note - is that even legal?).\n\nI came during happy hour on a nice day, sat outside, and figured I'd try the food at a discount.  The place was somewhat crowded.  People were waiting for seats, but there were a good number of empty tables indoors and out.\n\n$5 Stella's isn't really a great happy hour deal.\n\nI'd go back for the pizza . . . but only during happy hour.  It's good, but not $15+ good.\n\nThe hostess and server were clueless.  It was obvious that they either had no training or were trained poorly.  A hostess should be able to answer a simple question about the menu.  A server should know that you're ready for your check when your plates are stacked, your credit card has been waiting on the table, and one member of your party has left because it was taking too long.  I almost went inside to request the bill because I was so annoyed by the complete lack of urgency.\n\nI hope this place gets it together as I don't want to see yet another vacancy in Suburban Square.  Unfortunately, I doubt Parlor will last much longer considering the bad service and eight million other better / less expensive pizza options in the area.  Not the same sit down vibe, but Snap, Felicia's, and Jules are all within a quarter mile and have similar quality pizza at a fraction of the price - plus they're BYOB.

It is affiliated with the SkatePark of Tampa (SpoT) which has a shop next door and there are skateboard decks mounted on the walls of The Bricks as artwork and they play skate videos on the TVs above the bar; as I'm a skater myself, this is if anything just the icing on the cake for me. \n\nHowever, The Bricks' ardent support of skateboarding would not be enough to garner a five-star review alone, but thankfully it measures up in all other regards. The interior atmosphere is lively, inviting, and unique. The waitstaff and bartenders are on point, outgoing, friendly, and most importantly, quite prompt. As to the food, it's fairly simply fare but very tasty and very well-prepared. Tacos, a variety of Cuban sandwich variants, and some salads compose the lion's share of the menu. I had the Bird & Pig Cuban sandwich and also an order of chips and queso dip. The queso was especially good, which impressed me because too often things like queso are simply after-thoughts at bar-type restaurants. The sandwich itself was also very good. They have a full bar with a good selection of bourbons and ryes and also an expectedly good selection of beer, with an emphasis on Tampa's local brews. The wine list also looked better than you'd think for a casual bar atmosphere. Overall, it's clear they're investing in quality here. \n\nWhile their skateboarding association was enough to grab my attention to The Bricks, their stellar food and service are what really sets them apart. Ybor has a reputation for food being hit or miss, as is the case with many touristy areas, but The Bricks I found to be simply and casual yet truly impressive.", "date": "2015-11-18 18:37:44"}

Each night I dined with work  associates and throughout the meals the waiters kept trying to take away plates too soon.  It became difficult to have a relaxing dinner and constantly felt rushed.   On the 3rd night we spoke to the owner and it was clear that he did not want to take our complaint seriously and issued a very insincere apology.   In the end, he paid for our meals .  All of us at the table would have preferred that he would have acted more humble and treat us with more respect.  We were not looking for a free meal.  It was a company expense anyway.  We can only hope that he might think about what we told him.   We were most sincere and not trying to be difficult.  In his mind we were wrong and he was right.

I've been for dinner before and thought it was just okay, so I figured brunch couldn't be half bad.

He also brought a bowl of water for said dog.\n\nCons: everything else\n\nService was very slow. Parties that ordered after us received their food first.\n\nWe ordered an omelet and the French toast. First of all, the French toast is deep fried. Nothing in the description on the menu alluded to the fact that I would be served deep fried bread for breakfast. In what world does French toast = deep fried bread? It only tasted like oil, and when I poked the bread oil just oozed out. So essentially you're eating oil soaked bread for breakfast. Drowning it in syrup didn't help with the flavor either. \n\nThe omelet also came out and was clearly covered in oil. Surprise surprise, it also just tasted like oil. It was served with 2 cold pieces of toast.\n\nUnless you enjoy eating oil for breakfast, you're better off waiting in line at Fido or heading down the street to J Christopher's.

My parents ordered hot ginger tea which was equally novel and enjoyable.\n\nI typically have a hard time deciding for items on a large menu, so I simply asked my server for \"what do you have with shrimp and spicy?\" After a moment of reflexion, he took down my order which he said was \"not on the menu.\" I was excited. After patiently hearing the story of my parents' Thailand trip for ten minutes, he left for the kitchen.\n\nI was quickly presented with a starter coconut and mushroom soup. Perfectly heated, sour yet full, it was nothing short of delicious. The main course arrived soon afterwards. It consisted of a ball of steamed basmati rice, a small selection of deep fried specialties and a shrimp curry that would set the standard for all to come. Keeping a conversation was difficult as this was the sort of meal one savours in silence.\n\nI am typically not a dessert person, but decided to ask for the menu once more out of curiosity. Coconut ice cream, green tea ice cream, mango and sticky rice; we decided to taste some of each other's desserts. My ice cream had the texture of a sorbet but a rich taste, which combined with the sticky rice was simply delightful.\n\nThe total came in to just around 30 dollars per person including the 20% tip which, on the California coast, is completely reasonable. Set in a charming location and accompanied by a friendly staff, the Siam Elephant serves food that truly does justice to thai cuisine. Nothing comes to mind that could tarnish this great experience, and I therefore deem this restaurant worthy of the best rating.", "date": "2016-01-04 06:55:18"}

After searching on Yelp for gluten free restaurants in the area, I stumbled upon Blaze. The concept of this pizza joint is similar to Chipotle. You start off by selecting your dough and YES they have gluten free dough. There is a huge variety of toppings to chose from all very fresh and delicious. The oven they make you pizza is is quick and gives it amazing taste. I am from New York and though I had tried the best pizza in the world, well now I have. Staff was friendly and the pizza was done in no time. I love it so much I would even consider buying a franchise and take it to Miami!!

When I told the waiter that we had been waiting for 20 min for someone to come take our order she yelled at me \"Can't you see that we're busy!\" I've never been treated so badly here for so many years.

They offered us a free artichoke small plate because of a kitchen mistake. Lastly, I am on crutches and my mom didn't feel well so she went out to car early. One of the gentleman that waited on us carried our boxes out to the car and held my daughter's hand crossing the parking lot because he saw I couldn't carry anything while maneuvering my crutches.

It is heavenly. Say yes to the fried green tomatoes for a culinary history lesson. The gumbo ya-ya is assertive --thick and dark with every ingredient calling attention to its own importance. Whichever salad with fruit, go for it!! The first salad I had featured strawberries, and I was hooked. The latest featured poached pears and it made me make reservations for the very next day. If fruit isn't your thing, the Royal is delicious too. Good Lord, the shrimp and grits!  The barbecue shrimp is a bit of an improvisation. It may be a bit too foufou for the recipe purist. The shrimp with angel hair pasta is not of the slap-your-mama variety. It's the only thing on the menu I wouldn't order again, only because everlasting is so much better.

I've consistently had good food, though I struggle with the price for the value and portion size.  My most favorite foods there so far have been the fried tomatoes (on special), corn fritters, primal chili, crabcakes and blackened catfish.  Prices are too prohibitive on their charcoal menu offerings (with no sides?!?!) to entice me.  Service has always been quick and accomodating and all of my meals have always come out hot with the appropriate condiments.  Great bartending with special emphasis on liquor/cocktail knowledge AND food pairings.  I've never been bored with my bourbons there, and it never fails that I am offered something that I've not tried before.\n\nThe decor in the venue is simple yet interesting.  Whiskey barrels serve as seats and foundations for the tables and bar upstairs, though the hard bar seats are hell on the ass with little back support.  The lounge area has inviting couches, a fireplace and shuffleboard.  There's a distinct lack of scuzzy people hanging out and that's almost enough for me to give them an extra star!\n\nTwisted Tail has become a hotspot in the Delaware Valley for blues performers.  House band Mikey Junior and the Stone Cold Blues Band (have competed several years at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis) rock the spot weekly and host the Open Jam on Sunday evenings.  Other local and regional acts have graced the stage, to include Roger Girke, Georgie Bonds and Deb Callahan.  My only whine is that acoustically, the band space is far from perfect. The narrow chamber limits the ability to get a substantial audience in to see the musicians; there are only two tables on the floor up in the front of the room.  The bands are backed by glass windows and surrounded by brick in the long, narrow room; sound vigorously jettisons around in the room.  It would be easy to put some stylish acoustic material in the clamshell where the bands play to control some of the harshness.\n\nMy other criticism?  My sense is that the chef and management is overthinking, coming close to ruining the simplicity of southern cooking with nouvelle techniques and ideas.  This isn't a BBQ joint an they should probably stop peddling themselves as such unless they truly change the menu and employ KISS priciples.  In turn, they'd be bringing in far more people and getting far better reviews with easier-to-deliver fare.", "date": "2012-02-03 04:58:24"}

After minutes of trying to figure out the artificial flavor that was so overpowering, we came to the conclusion that it was the juice from the bottle of Maraschino cherries.  \nThe side of coleslaw was ok, very light on the mayo and sprinkled with pineapple and raisins.

You truly won't be disappointed.\n\nOur agenda this last trip to Nashville was strictly going to see a show at the Opry.  Luck would have it, I was able to snag a room on a Saturday night when the town was hopping with concerts galore all over the city.  I have seen parts of this resort in my other trips there but realized pretty quick that there's more to see!\n\nOnce on the grounds, parking is a bit tricky.  Finally found a human who directed us to self parking - they offer valet but it was closed this particular day.  There are not a lot of open spots in self parking so you may want to valet.  I'm not sure of the cost of valet but self was $29 with in and out privileges.  Once in the lobby we were directed to the correct check in line as this place was packed!\n\nThe hotel is broken up into 3 main categories - Cascades, Delta & Magnolia.  Each one is its one little world and all are connected as well.  We were in Magnolia, found our way to our room via map and got settled in.  Room was typical, there is outside access from each room with a patio which is nice.\n\nThe Opry and the Opry Mills mall are all easily accessible from the resort by resort shuttle, which is included in your daily resort fee.  The run shuttles for both literally all day and night, which is super nice.  The drivers are awesome and very engaging with the guests.  Your resort fee also includes other fun perks but we were not there long enough to enjoy them.\n\nI'm giving 4 stars because of check-out, which is really my only issue.  One of the staff members told us, and another couple, that if we gave them our room key, they would be checked out and our bill would be emailed to us.  So we did that...and I never got the final bill.  I tried contacting and never heard back.  No biggie in reality but if you're going to tell your guests that, please do it.\n\nIf not in Nashville for downtown, check out Gaylord.  It was pretty amazing!", "date": "2018-09-26 18:07:31"}

On one the food was decent, and nothing to really complain about, standard bar fare with a really tasty item called the chingalinga I think.  But on the otherhand it was 'merkinized mexican bar food.  One thing we for sure will get next time will be the grilled chicken nachos instead of the shredded chicken.  Just too bland.\n\nThe drinks also had some duality.  We had two of the special drinks and those were really good.  But my standard bloody mary was so lame that the waiter took it on himself to make me one with much more flavor.  I know, I know bloody mary requests at a Cantina?  \n\nThe atmosphere in the bar is actually nice and open when we went.  It seems lots of the Victorian bars have this same vibe.  \n\nAnd thankfully the prices during happy hour were really good.

The beds are comfortable and my room had a balcony overlooking their magnificent gardens, so I was not completely isolated.

It was early am when we landed so of course they weren't ready for us but would call us when they were, no later than 3.  There was some confusion at check-in but we thought it had been taken care of.  Only to find out later, it was still messed up.  We received notice that our room was ready at 4:30 and collected our keys and attempted to get into our room, our keys were not programmed.  Luckily there was a house staff member who also tried our keys as well but eventually used his key to gain entry.  Once inside, the check-in issue that we thought was resolved was not: 2 female colleagues, 1 king bed.  Originally, we had booked & pre-paid for 2 separate rooms, they had asked of we would share- it was unexpected, but we were flexible.  That is until we found out 'sharing' meant the same bed!\n\nWe immediately contacted customer service only to wait in the phone system for 20 minutes and another 5 before they thought bringing us a roll away would be acceptable.  NOT EVEN!  So after going back and forth our mysterious reservation appeared and we both ended up with king rooms; however we missed happy hour with our team.\n\nThat leads us to dinner....the steakhouse was too pricy and Solario, the Conservatory bar and Ravello's were closed, JD's had a 45m wait so we continued to Delta Island where our disappointment grew into aggravation.

She asked if I had been happy with it and I said yes, but she said nothing further. This should have been my sign to go with something else. When my $15 salmon came, it was seriously the tiniest piece of salmon I've ever been served (maybe about the size of 1/3 of a napkin and very thin), and the greens under it were puny. I told her I didn't remember it being that small, and she said that was why she had asked me about it originally. Had she actually SAID it will be very small for the price, I wouldn't have ordered it. I looked at my BF's large plate full of chicken kabob and potatoes hungrily. I told her I wanted to order the kabob instead, and for some reason she said the manager had to come talk to me. Then when he got there, she clearly had not explained anything to him and had made it sound like I had asked for him. I told him the issue and he was more than happy to make me a new plate.

I think my friend ordered the special Paella one night and it was appalling. It smelled like we were sitting across a fish farm pier and rotting socks. I cannot believe they even called that Paella, it was sitting in a pool of oil and had squash and uncleaned mussels and mushy rice. \n\nAs for the fish tacos, super bland tilapia and watery salsa. No thank you! The rice and beans were a saving grace. \n\nIt's a pretty large venue and I see it being great for large groups.

Their Bloody Marys are very good although some of the drinks are a bit overpriced for what they are. The overpriciness also applies to the food.

It took me 22 minutes to get there and I was asked to wait, which I did, thinking I would wait only while they finished packaging my food. A full 10 minutes after I got there, my food came out. What I was told would be 20 minutes turned into 32 minutes. I ordered Vegetable Biriyani (special instruction to make it spicy). I got what I ordered and enjoyed the meal. They were not busy. In fact, there were only two other customers there at the time. \n\nTwo days later, I called from my home and placed another order. I ordered the exact sme thing and was again told it would be 20 minutes. Knowing I had to wait last time, I planned on it taking 30 minutes and left my home accordingly. Bad traffic enroute caused me to arrive at the resuaurant (hole-in-the-wall, dive, dump) 40 minutes after I placed my order. I was told to have a seat and they'd get my food. I asked why it wasn't ready yet as it had been double the time they said and was told it was on the way. \n\nRealising quickly that it wasn't, I inquired again and was told the same thing, but I can go ahead and pay. I did not. I asked why 25 minutes after I was told my order would be ready, it wasn't ready yet. The answer I was given was that It's coming and thet I can go ahead and pay for it. I did not. I told them this is not an example of good customer service and I would expect my food within 2 minutes or I would leave. During these two minutes, I was told three more times that I should pay for my order, to which I made it clear that I would not until I was satisfied my order was delivered before my deadline. \n\nMy food came out of the kitchen at the deadline and I was asked again to pay for it. Before doing so, I wanted to inspect the food. Upon loking in the container, I noticed it looked different then it did two days prior. My first thought was that it was not prepared spicy, as I had ordered. I asked if it was spicy. They said it was not spicy, but regular...and proceeded to tell me my total once again. I told them this is not what I ordered and that I would not pay for it or anything else here again. They said they'd take it back and fix it. Too late. By now they had taken almost 50 minutes to make something they originally told me would take 20 minutes. \n\nAt this point, another person there came out and said they had accidentlly given my order to someone else. Ok, if this had happened, they had plenty of time to make another order for me. But we know this did not happen and they were just plain lying to me. \n\nI left without paying. Shame, as the food I got two days before was actually good. It would not have as bad if they had any customer service skills. Not once did anyone apologise for the delay or problem. Not once did anyone offer me a glass (or bottle) of water, or any other beverage. The only things they would say to me were that the food was coming and that I could pay. \n\nThere is Taj just a couple of blocks away and is a much better option.", "date": "2016-06-13 15:10:45"}

So many childhood memories here too. Be prepared to pay big bucks for really good pizza.", "date": "2016-11-13 16:55:34"}

From the level of irritation of us walking in as the staff was just setting up (we walked in at 10:45am, the restaurant opens at 10:30am as posted on the website), for brunch, to the series of unreal circumstances that took place over the next hour, I am still in a state of shock. We were ignored for the first ten minutes, despite my asking if we had somehow arrived \"too early\" and getting a simple \"you're fine\" in response, no eye contact, and no attempt to counter the whispering in each other's ears and rolling their eyes at us. \nFast forward to the meal, we received our appetizers of tater tots and then our waitress, Katie, went back to drinking beer at the bar with the other servers while we sat in search of ketchup. I finally got up and went to the bar to ask the gentleman bartender for ketchup. Katie then retrieved two sides of ketchup for us. When I said thank you, her response was \"sure\". (Also, I can look past the blond hair that was inside our tots but it was adding insult to injury at this point.)\nOur breakfast came, the food was indeed good but the service was soooo bad. My two boys eventually went to sit on the leather couch and play together, clearly disturbing the on-shift wait staff eating at the bar and chatting. When my boys walked back to the table they were saturated with the smell of body odor from the couch. I mentioned to one of the male members of the wait staff, that the leather sofa smelled and that they might want to wipe them down when the day was through. He said \"oh, really, I can't tell, my sense of smell isn't all that good\" and then \"we'll make Katie take care of it\" as he walked over to Katie and another female to openly mock me for making a comment on the couch. All of this in front of my children, the oldest of which was completely confused by why his mom was being made fun of.

If you're on a pier and offer clam chowder, you better make it good!! To be fair, I was at Old Fisherman's wharf the weekend before and then I had Pike's Place Chowder up in Seattle within the last year. Did not like the thick chowder texture. It was thick in the wrong way, where it was separating into chunks after 10 mins of eating. The clam taste was not infused very well into the soup either, it was 2 independent flavors from each other. The soup was herb-y flavored, more so than clam flavored.\n\n-CRAB CAKES: the worst crab cake I've ever had! I usually love crab cakes, but this one BARELY tasted like crab. Probably because of all the spice they put into it. If anything it almost had a slight curry taste. For a SEAFOOD restaurant ON a pier, I was expecting nice fresh chunks of sweet crab meat!! NONE of that, the crab was really fine (almost like canned?? texture) and there was absolutely NO sweet crab here, just spice flavoring. I was better off feeding $14 to a seagull.\n\n-FRESH CLAMS IN BROTH: this was the saving grace of the entire meal. The clams were sooo fresh, super sweet and great texture! The broth had a little too much white wine & not enough garlic for my taste. It was also on the salty side, but the clams! OMG, the clams!!!

They even have a loyalty program! I don't think there are really any other businesses like it in this area of town and it makes a awesome meeting space given its location in this neighborhood. My only peeve about it is parking. There is a small, one way lot outside but you can hardly ever find parking there. Your best bet is a paid lot next to the complex it is located in or street parking if you are lucky.", "date": "2015-09-10 16:35:24"}

As far as the food was concerned, I was pretty underwhelmed, if I'm being honest. Having rather recently dined at a different seafood boil establishment (The Shaking Crab in Norfolk VA), I had a pretty good comparison pretty fresh in my mind, and with that, The Boiling House under-delivered. \n\nCelebrating my mothers graduation, we decided to stop in and get a little messy on some seafood!.....or Vietnamese noodles. Apparently this place is both a seafood boil AND Asian noodle house. Ooook. After my mom threw the whole night into turmoil by ordering off the menu (which the staff WERE gracious enough to accommodate), we got on track and ordered. One vegan in our party went with just cajun fries. (Not many vegan options here, if thats a concern for you.) Another has an issue with seeing her food look like it looks before its food (why did we come here again?) so she went with some noodles, and my mother was playing fast and loose with the menu, so as far as the SEAFOOD BOIL goes, it was down to my sister and I to split a bucket. Snow crab legs, shrimp, potatoes, corn and a ciabatta roll; boiling house sauce, medium. \n\nFirst thing that was weird was that although everything has to be ordered by the pound, our crab legs had to be ordered in 1 1/4 pound increments. uh.....ok. Whatever. Second thing is that, the corn was mushy. Boiling corn must be a hard thing to do, as it was the same problem at the Shaking Crab. Third thing, and this is a big deal, were the shrimp. The shrimp were a good size, but they may as well have been made of pencil erasers. They were SOOOOOO chewy, and way more egregious than that, the shrimp weren't cleaned. Yuck. It took me 10 minutes before I could even start eating, because I had to clean every shrimp myself. \n\nThe rest of the food was OKAY. The crab legs were fine, the potatoes were fine, but nothing blew me away. The sauce was.....ok. Decent flavor, decent heat....a little watery....I was just like, \"meh,\" the whole meal. \n\nOur server was cool, and put up with a lot, (my mother is a handful) but he was polite throughout; asking the kitchen to make her special dish, and even pointing out to us that there is a military discount, so we got 10% off of the meal. \n\nThe place was nice inside and its BYOB with no corkage, so they definitely have that going for them. \n\nI can't say for sure either way if I'd be back or not. Again, I wasn't thrilled with the meal, but aside from the shrimp, I wasn't put off by anything either. I guess we'll see.\n\nOh, the floor is like the Icecapades. We all almost broke our necks walking in, and our waiters assistant slipped and knocked over a bucket of ice. Wear something with some grip.", "date": "2018-05-20 19:43:33"}

First, the tour guide didn't speak to the entire group, he addressed only 1 person in the group; there were 20 people in our group. Second, he never gave the group a full description of the places we went to, or anything regarding the area we were going to.  Third, the pizza places were so so, but nothing that great.  There were only 3 stops on the tour, and again, I couldn't tell you why these 3 places were selected as the tour guide did not say.  The first place you had a choice of 2 types of cheese pizza, the second place you got half a slice of pizza, and third place you got a slice of either cheese or pepperoni; horrible selection for a \"pizza tour\".

Towels, sheets and blankets are clean but thin and scratchy. The beds are comfortable.\n\nThe room could have been cleaned more thoroughly. It wasn't obviously dirty, but finding a pair of socks left by a previous occupant hiding under the curtains didn't inspire my confidence in the housekeeping.\n\nThe location is far from everything, so it's a hike to try to get to other options for food, etcetera, so you're stuck with hour long waits for a cup of coffee or a frozen McDonald's quality burger and paying $6 for a box of 10 tampons in the gift shop.", "date": "2015-02-03 20:47:19"}

We've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to be seated. They've got a large selection of beer and wine, both domestic and international. It's always fun to try something new when ever we go. Sadly, Terra Sur is too far from where we live but it's a great place to visit when we are in the area. It's always a nice, random surprise!\n\nFor starters, we've tried the Teque\u00f1os y Yuquitas Fritas and Pulpo al Olivo. I always love fried goodies, especially when there is cheese involved (Really though, who doesn't love this?). So, the teque\u00f1os and yuquitas were pretty good, particularly with the dipping sauces. I don't recall their names exactly but they were green and orange-ish, and definitely spicy! I recommend them both. The pulpo (octopus) had a nice texture to it, definitely chewy but not to the point where your jaw gets tired from it. A negative for me was that I thought the appetizer would have had more octopus. I was disappointed to see only 5-6 pieces of pulpo on our plate. On the upside, the black olive puree was delicious and the chimichurri was fantastic.\n\nFor entrees, we've had the Ceviche de Camaron, Chupe and Jalea. I've grown up eating my dad's Ecuadorian ceviche, which is different than Peruvian ceviche. So, I'll admit I was skeptical that this ceviche would be good. I won't say that it surpassed my dad's ceviche because all components of it were completely different than my dad's; however, Terra Sur's ceviche was incredibly good and fresh. A small order of the shrimp ceviche was enough for my dinner and a couple bites for my husband to try. \n\nThe Chupe is a delicious seafood broth made up of potatoes, peas, an egg, rice, corn and lima beans with either shrimp or a mixed combination of shrimp and fish. I've gained confidence in Terra Sur's fresh seafood so I went for the mixed Chupe with shrimp and red snapper. WOW! This was so flavorful and hearty. I could imagine myself eating this soup for breakfast in the mountains of Peru. It was really good. I finished the entire soup myself, to the waiter's surprise and my own! \n\nLastly, the Jalea is what I would say is the Peruvian version of a fried sampler dish. You can find mussels, calamari, fish, shrimp and yuca, all fried to a delicious golden brown. On the side, you get your fresh corn and cancha to add to the mix. Also, they include a cup of marinated red onions (on the side) to top off the fried goodies. What a great mix of textures and flavors!\n\nWe will come back to Terra Sur should we ever be in the neighborhood. Hands down, a really good place to eat!", "date": "2015-02-25 14:42:17"}

I ordered the salmon omelet and my wife ordered eggs, pancakes and sausage.  The salmon omelet was flavorful and the Old Bay sour cream was a nice touch that worked well.  My wife found her meal totally unremarkable - not bad, but nothing we couldn't have done at least as well at home.  The prices were pretty reasonable for a sit down restaurant on the Main Line ($9.50 for the salmon omelet).  \n\nThe service was pleasant enough, but a touch erratic - it was quite a while before I was offered a coffee refill, for example.  After we got the bill, we found that my wife had been charged incorrectly for her order, and when she asked to get it corrected, was briefly lectured on the confusing way in which she'd ordered before they agreed to change the bill.  \n\nOverall, our experience wasn't bad - the high points were the salmon omelet and the outdoor seating on a beautiful day - but we'd be more inclined to keep looking for a really good brunch near Wynnewood than  to make a return visit.", "date": "2010-10-11 03:26:55"}

I can't recommend this place enough and I look forward to going back", "date": "2018-08-15 20:07:55"}

Often, we order delivery--we're told it'll take the usual 30-45 minutes, but it always comes 10-15 minutes later (we live close, so this might vary). Even with this glorious speed, everything is so freshly made, perfectly cooked, and delicious. \n\nMy husband and I want everyone to know that Misto Diner is where it's at. We've tried just about all of the other Chinese cuisine in the area, and we haven't found anything that comes near Misto's quality. (We haven't tried the sushi, but surely it's just as good.) Our favorites: the house special pan fried noodles, all of the various fried rices, boneless spare ribs, teriyaki beef sticks, the omelets, chicken with peanuts, pepper steak, fried shrimp... everything. I especially love their chicken dishes because they're cut into narrow strips, clean of fat and other nasty things, and perfectly cooked. This includes the chicken rice soup. To make sure I don't forget--get soup! It comes with home made crunchy rice noodles and they are ridonkulous. I would pay to have those for the rest of my life. \n\nThis place is affordable, provides tons of food for the price, and just so, so good.

They love love love Jackson's from their time in college, and therefore it was literally our first stop of the weekend -- and it was wonderful. I wasn't sure what to expect, since it was a favorite from college days -- but the food was simply delicious.\n\nIt has a low-key easy vibe inside, with art from local artists for sale, and the Bistro description is perfect to describe the food. Not heaping portions, but I was stuffed at the end of the meal, and absolutely satisfied.   We started off with martinis which were delightfully strong and full of flavor, and headed for lunch at a table shortly thereafter. Since it was a celebratory weekend, we started with appetizers, and the spinach dip, and the pigs in blankets with the amazing spicy mustard went in seconds. All very flavorful, I just wish I could have had another bite -- and take gallons of the mustard home with me.\n\nHeading to lunch, I got the Rio Panini, and since I do love the standard thick bread one would think of for a panini, I was slightly sad to see white sandwich bread. It was a great sandwich, as were the fries, and the chips that I tasted off my friends plate. I think next time I'll go with the Rio wrap instead -- had ordering envy of my friends who went with that selection. But was in no way dissatisfied with my choice.\n\nI was back again in Nashville this weekend, and stopped again with a large group for lunch. I expected a wait, as the bistro was packed with World Cup fans, but they easily worked with us, and found us a table quickly. Again, each person in the group constantly remarked on the quality of the food, and each had a different drink -- mine, the misery & gin -- pear cider, st. germain ginger liquor, and Tanqueray, was light and refreshing -- perfect for a hot day.  This time, I got this shrimp wrap, and the chopped salad, and ate every morsel off my plate. The shrimp had a slight kick to it, and it had so many flavors in each bite, I savored it until the very end.\n\nI can say without a doubt that every time I'm in Nashville, I will absolutely be back for another boozy lunch at Jackson's!", "date": "2010-07-12 16:08:51"}

Since we were hungry, we just took a seat and figured that we'd wait until they were open. I swear at least 20 people came in after us, and the hostess had to perform the same song and dance about how the restaurant wasn't open for dinner service yet, but that they would be happy to accept walk-ins. She kept a smile the whole time and it sounded like it was the first time that she had to say that spiel that night. The reason that I'm commenting on this is because it is so easy to start getting irritated to have to say the same thing over and over, yet this woman greeted each guest as if they were the first group of people to walk in the doors that night.\n \nWe were actually seated a few minutes before 5:30, which I was surprised, but very pleased with.

She said that it was cooked exactly how she ordered it, and was absolute perfection. We shared the Jumbo Sea Scallops as an appetizer. They were cooked beautifully. I had the brandy & apple cider braised rabbit, and could not believe how juicy it was. Rabbit is one of those proteins that can easily dry out, so I was very impressed. We ordered the Profiteroles & chocolate sauce to go (we had a short walk back to our hotel so we knew that the ice cream would not melt.) Very good meal all around, and I will be back next time I'm in New Orleans!", "date": "2014-12-18 16:37:38"}

Visited Morton's for a birthday celebration with my 2 best friends.   We noted in the reservation that his was a birthday celebration for the three of us.  No mention of this by the waiter. No big deal.   Our waiter comes to the table introduces himself n reads the specials.  Not very descriptive.  We order drinks I order a beer, they don't have it in stock.  Don't tell me what they have just ask if I'd like a soda.  Ok.  Bring us our menus n two minutes later is back for our order, we say we need a few minutes.  He took that literally and was back in three minutes. I ask if they have Chicago style, he says that just means it's on the bone.  Uhmmmm no it doesn't.   I'm already disappointed.   We order.  I get a rib eye medium Oscar style.  One gets filet Oscar style n we order one rib eye medium well.  Do not order Oscar style.  It was flavorless with raw asparagus n by no means should they say lump crabmeat.  The steak that was to be medium well, was rare.  Had to be ant back twice.  My steak was also rare, tough n chewy.  The filet was rare but my gf said flavorful.  She also thought the Oscar style was worse she ever had.  Sides:  onion rings.  Good. Hot. Crispy.   Creamer spinach, no flavor and not real\nHot.  Sour cream mashed potatoes , not hot. Bland.  We are not big complainers, we just asked to have our food wrapped to go  n we would instead indulge in dessert.  We read rave reviews about the sundae n the hot chocolate cake.  We were actually excited that we weren't to full j would be able to enjoy dessert. We asked for the dessert menu.  The waiter brings it to the table, he then leans over n whispers the ones in the box are our house specialities.  They take 30 minutes as they are prepared fresh.  Oooh. Goood!  He then finishes the statement with they are not worth the wait. What????? He obviously wanted us out so he could get another seating.  He comes back and asks us if we would like to try one of the other desserts.  Uhm, no.  Check please.    Almost $400 with tip.  I swear to you I had a better steak at Applebee's.   What waiter tells you the house specialties aren't worth the wait?   Save your money. On a brighter note the waiters waiting on other tables sounded great!

I came here while visiting Nashville and I really wish we had this place in Chicago.\n\nI ordered a Build Your Own Salad with arugula, chicken, goat cheese, strawberries, and vanilla-poached pears. Super fresh and healthy. They do cram the salad into this jam-packed plastic container, and when you open the container, your salad contents will likely overflow out of the container. Why is it not socially acceptable to eat salad out of a huge basin-like serving bowl?? :)\n\nThey also had this amazing-looking section of desserts. I ordered the peach carrot cake, which unfortunately was just okay. The frosting was buttercream; it probably would have been better with cream cheese frosting. It's a definite pass, so only deducting one star due to the sub-par dessert. But I would definitely return!", "date": "2017-10-12 17:01:43"}

The Whole Foods right outside of STL (Brentwood), had got me excited about Whole Foods once more.

Their pastry case is all of two or three feet long. The one in St. Louis? Probably four times that length. \n\nWhere were the cream puffs? The non mini tarts? Or any fruit tarts besides mixed berry? Where were the french inspired pastries? Or the vegan ones? Where was any of this?\n\nInstead there were pudding cups (I bought one - it was very pretty and did use very rich chocolate, but was still just a bit better than a normal pudding cup), creme brulee, two types of macaron flavors, and only a few cakes (albeit I am sure you can call in advance to order others as you can at most Whole Foods). There were mini tarts, but all the same mixed berry flavors... There was no layered deserts or tiramisu.\n\nIt was just a below average bakery selection and it left me sad (as I had driven there hungry and wanting pastries)\n\nMaybe the other location in Indy will prove more fruitful?

The eggs and bacon were decent. Two bloody Mary's were watered down and bland. The one star review is reflected by the service. We had some of the most inattentive service in NOLA (in about 10 trips over the past 5 years) and that's saying a lot as things here move at a much slower pace in general. Forgot coffee order, forgot Bloody drink order, no coffee refill, no follow up whatsoever from our waitress on anything and had to ask for literally every single item needed including utensils. The closest thing to a modicum of service I had was from the water guys. Walked out with $100 check for brunch and a feeling that they could care less about us as a customer.

Really cute and comfortable furniture lines one wall while a bar with chairs lines the windowed wall.  The employees are NICE, something oddly lacking in a lot of Philly coffee shops.  They are also talented baristas and my drinks are consistent and damn tasty.  My favorite drink is their seasonal Ancho Chile Hot Chocolate- my god! It's pricey but you can taste why.  The drink is pure bliss, chocolatey and sweet, milky and smooth but with a spice and little bits of ancho chile to chew on between sips.  \n\nI've also had plain coffee, of which you have a choice of roasts, and a few other fancy coffees.  Someday I'l try one of their paninis or vegan sweets and see if they are worthy of a fifth star.  \n\nOne time I stupidly spilled a large portion of my drink while trying to add cream and sugar  with the same hand I was using to hold a dog leash(did I mention you can take your doggie here).  The dog pulled and coffee went everywhere.  Fail.  The baristas were so nice, they didn't get mad at me, helped me clean up and refilled my coffee.

Portions were on the small side, as I think I was able to count the number of penne in my side of pasta.  On a more positive note,  we had a party of eight which can sometimes be a problem on a busy Friday night, yet the service was still very good. Now a BYOB.", "date": "2008-01-01 18:24:49"}

I have been enjoying lunch dates here with my mom since I was just a teen and it was located across the street at a much smaller, more intimate space. Good for them for the move and new addition of a bar and fireplace, but it loses a little something with the new big vaulted ceilings. They were always packed so I do get it, but I prefer the more cozy feel the other location had. \n\nFood wise, you will not be disappointed driving out of your way, even from the city, for a meal here. Honestly. Veg or not, the food is absolutely fantastic!! The menu is very creative, taking notes from many different types of cuisines from Asian to Cuban, etc. Menu highlights I feel show its uniqueness are: Pumpkin seed crusted tofu, maple mustard vinaigrette, pickled red onions and Tabasco Mayo, to name a few. Every dish is absolutely packed with flavor! You cannot go wrong with anything here.\n\nThey soups are to die for! They are not listed on the menu as the change daily. A bowl will cost just under $10 but can definitely be split or eaten as an entire meal. Their spicy Thai peanut was the stuff (my) dreams were made of. Very disappointed they removed it from the menu, but from what our waiter said, it's in high demand so maybe they will bring it back! I used to take a quart of it home every visit! Most recently we tried two.... a creamy, cinnamony butternut squash with maple crema and toasted seeds and a white miso packed with veggies. Both so fantastic we couldn't choose a favorite! You must try one! \n\nWe usually stick to cubano sammies. They have over half a dozen varieties. They are rather large and made on the most perfectly crispy toasted baguette. They come plated with a side salad that is not to be overlooked. Mixed greens with house balsamic, currants and white marcona almonds! Yum! We usually get the portobello which we love. Most recently we opted for a chickpea fritter sammy and it was very tasty! \n\nThe apps are also fantastic and definitely leave some room for the desserts or take one home! They have decadent vegan ones too! Oh wow! \n\nThe menu is clearly marked vegan or \"dairy free upon request\". Again, you don't have to be strictly veg to thoroughly enjoy a meal here, but if you are, the plethora of delicious options is pure heaven. \n\nAlthough I'm mostly here during lunch hours and don't really see it, I do believe it's BYO too! So bring those bottles. \n\nA must try! A huge winner especially for the area!!", "date": "2016-12-22 12:55:10"}

The atmosphere is gorgeous; it was so cozy and beautifully decorated. I immediately fell in love. \n\nWe were seated and immediately attended to by our super friendly waitress. \n\nWe started with the layered pita dip as an appetizer. It's not listed on their online menu, so I don't remember the description or what was in it. It was pretty tasty, even if the pita chips were a little too hard. \n\nFor my entree, I went with the grilled lamb kabob. It came with lemon oregano roasted potatoes, and the whole dish was seasoned with what tasted a lot like balsamic vinegar. Don't get me wrong; I love balsamic. But it was a little overpowering. And while the flavor of the lamb was good, it was way too tough for me. I was literally chewing on each piece for at least a couple minutes before I could get it down.  \n\nOne huge complaint was the arrival time of the food. My friend's gyro arrived about 15 minutes before everyone else's food. And the layered pita dip, which was supposed to be the appetizer, arrived with the main course. \n\nAnyway, once the meal was complete, paying for it was a problem. The waitress refused to split the check, even though there were just 3 of us. Ugh. None of us had cash, so we handed her our cards and told her which items should go onto each card. Not too difficult, right? Well, somehow she managed to screw that up, and ended up double charging my friend's credit card. \n\nAnyway, despite the mediocre food and service headaches, I'll probably be back to Momo's at least one more time.

The guy at the front patiently listened to what I was talking and said it's fine, I could come pick up. \n\nArrived 15 min past closing and guess what; they were still open. Picked up my order and thanked them for their service. \n\nEnjoyed my meal and all set to drive next morning to my destination!", "date": "2018-04-17 15:35:30"}

As we walked in, they were putting up a sign saying that for students with a government issued ID; food was 10% off. I of course just happened to have my campus ID card and they were only too happy to let me use it. Then came the menu. It's a bit sparse, but that's really what makes the food so affordable and good; it allows for the chef to prepare a dish quickly and to the best of his ability; as well as cut down on excess expenses to keep countless different ingredients in stock. Subsequently, the cost of the food is unreal, it's less than 6 dollars for a full cut of chicken Katsu, which for us came out in a matter of minutes. Not only was it speedy though, but there was just so much of it! The bowl that the ramen came in was huge; and compared to the costs of other nearby restaurants, would have easily cost 15 instead of 10. Overall, I was very happy with the wonderful, bubbly service as well as the quality, cost, and quantity provided ^_^\n\nAlso, the waiter just made the experience much more enjoyable; I don't understand why people would see him as annoying..

I came here with my girlfriend the day before Valentine's Day on a trip to Philadelphia from New York City, with a reservation. \n\nCutting to the chase, the cost of this dining experience was extremely inflated. We payed Michelin star prices for a meal experience reminiscent of a $40 dollar NYC midtown theatre pre-fixe, which is a generous comparison.\n\n1. After ordering our food, the waiter never once checked on its preparation or how we were enjoying it. We poured our own wine for the duration of the meal. Again, no big deal, but at $120 per person, I like to expect some degree of attentive service. This felt more like a service at a cheap all-inclusive resort.\n\n2. We waited 45 minutes for our entree, which was mediocre at best. The restaurant is extremely understaffed and it shows painfully. Interestingly enough, we received two desserts consecutively, only to have the second taken from our table when they realized they had over-served. (The exorbitant price - $68 per person - only gets you and your partner a shared mousse and grape-sized portion of sorbet.) There is no organization here - no sense of professionalism from the staff.\n\n3. Returning to the crux of my complaint, the value of this meal is simply non-existent. This is faux-fine dining. For a shot glass of soup, two minuscule courses, and a shared dessert, you will pay an arm and a leg. If you are willing to look past the racket they are running at Bistro St. Tropez, then you will enjoy your time here. Coming from Manhattan, I am used to paying a premium on dining, especially during holidays. At the risk of sounding like a snob, I've spent three-times what I've spent per person on this meal and felt satisfied. Here, I felt robbed.\n\n4. The environment does not make up for the value. The restaurant is located in what is essentially the fourth floor abandoned construction site The dining quarters are cramped and the decor is outdated and uninspired. Only a neon sign on the other side of the restaurant provided any semblance of ambience. Expect to be packed into tables like sardines.\n\nUltimately, we left feeling dissatisfied, hungry, and taken advantage of. After a post meal discussion, we learned other diners felt similarly, confessing to us that they were heading to grab take-out Chinese food after their meal. Not the best way to spend a holiday weekend, nor to blow hard-earned money. Please do yourself and your date a favor and do your due diligence:  avoid this so-called \"bistro\" and visit a quality dining establishment that values your time and money.", "date": "2016-02-14 03:15:38"}

I was wrong.  I only gave 3 stars instead of 2 because the entire staff was incredibly nice.  First of all the place is a maze which we did end up laughing at.  There are signs but the signage is not good.  I can see where someone who stays there all the time might enjoy the place (if you can afford a higher end room).  For new-bees it was just about 18 hours of confusion.  We stayed in Magnolia and I loved the outdoor pool there (and it was close) but it closes at 6 and doesn't open till 10.  If you want to enjoy a pool you have to go somewhere else and even with all our exploring I never even noticed a sign for it.  It's summer, it's hot and people like to swim outdoors.  Check in was like moving cattle, check out at Magnolia was painless.  The room was adequate but nothing special, clean but a little dated.  Parking-I've stayed at some high end hotels and most validate parking for guests.  We valet parked for about 35 dollars but self parking with ta was still about 25 dollars.  Huge drawback.  In our situation we were stuck eating at the hotel.  We ended up eating at Jack Daniels which was very good.  Breakfast was another story.  The only restaurant available for breakfast was at the other end of the complex.  When you're hungry and need coffee the last thing you want to do is walk a country mile to eat. Again breakfast was an astronomical price for a good breakfast that would be half the price anywhere else.

All of these dishes are competently prepared with ingredients of a decent quality, though the cooks tend to oversalt things a bit. Despite some flaws I consider Misto's food the best Chinese in Bensalem.\n\nMisto also has some of the highest prices. Although the quality of the food is laudable and consistent, the prices are steep ($10-12 for a dinner combo).

I normally go to the State St Reginelli's, but since moving further downtown this location is more convenient to me.\nWe should have left the moment we went to go sit near the window and there was a SWARM of flies near the table. Blech. We decided to sit in a booth, which was still dirty from the last customers, but we didn't have much of a choice since most of the tables were either dirty, still had plates on them, or were occupied.\nAnother thing I noticed was that this location was very dark. Maybe I hadn't noticed it before because I had only come during the day? I don't know. At this point, my GF and I had already sat down and ordered our drinks so we decided to stay, but we felt very uncomfortable.\nThe combination of the darkness, dirtiness, and flies everywhere made me scarf down my pizza just so we could get the hell out of there. Like I said, our food was fine, but next time I am craving Reginelli's I will make sure to go to the State St location even if they chronically mess up my take out orders, they always get it right when I dine in.", "date": "2012-09-17 15:35:34"}

Both my experiences as a party of 3 warranted 4 stars but my experience this past weekend as a party of 7 to celebrate my birthday was not as good.\n\nWe were promptly greeted upon arrival and seated at a large booth.  They allowed us to order first for the two toddlers in the party which is always good.  Trouble is that the rest of us waited an additional 30 minutes to get our food after the toddlers were served.  We arrived before 5pm on a Sunday ANC the adults did not receive their entrees until 550PM.  By then, the toddlers were done and ready to run amok. \n\nThe kid meals themselves were not easily handled by the children.  The bun on the cheeseburger meal was huge and outnumbered the patty at least by a ratio of 6:1.  The chicken strips were oddly enough in what appeared to be a thick need batter that my 5 year old could barely bite through.  Side note: kids' meals here do not come with fruit/cookie/dessert.  \n\nFor appetizers we shared the spinach artichoke dip (yummy) with warmed tortilla chips BUT our plate had what seemed to be the end of a bag with 50% broken so much that we could not put any dip on them.\n\nNext, we shared the southwest egg rolls which were a big hit with everyone!  They come with a cilantro ranch style dipping sauce.\n\nAnd we also shared the jalape\u00f1o cheese bites which came out like warm and not ooey gooey at all - it was as if they sat for 10 minutes before coming to us.  And as far as spice goes, I didn't notice any at all.  I'm not sure these would pass the test even if they were piping hot.\n\nFinally... Dinner arrives.  I have to admit that my steak fajitas were excellent - moist, tender, flavorful BUT the $4 add on spicy garlic lime shrimp were a huge disappointment.  The shrimp were laid atop the skillet and not even the tiniest bit hot - they were room temp and rubbery :-( Pretty steep to charge $4 for rubbery room temp. Shrimp.\n\nAlso in out party, a 6 oz. sirloin was enjoyed cooked to perfection, ribs, and lettuce wraps.\n\nOverall the food was pretty good but it was the service or lack there of for timing that was a complete bust.\n\nEnded the meal without dessert because by that time the children were ready to leave.\n\nOverall, I'd come back again in a smaller group but it was a bust for my party of 7.", "date": "2014-04-02 13:44:18"}

This is how I would describe the customer service at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel and Convention Center. \n\nI will start upon arriving at the facility: The valet staff should probably wear smiles and act as if we as guests are not an inconvenience. After all, this is there job. Easily dismissed though as everyone can have a less than great day. It was also 1:00AM local time. \n\nUpon entering the hotel (I refuse to refer to it as a resort which I'll explain later) I was awestruck by the beauty of the lobby and the gardens at the opposite end. This is of course where the pleasurable experience stopped, abruptly. Upon check in we were rudely greeted by a gentleman telling me my room rate was incorrect and it would be $100 higher than my reservation. Despite it being late, I calmly asked why the discrepancy? He couldn't advise me of a straight answer and of course no management staff was available. I had asked for other facilities in the area to which I was informed they were all booked. I'm curious as to know how he knew such a thing! Reluctantly, I checked in and was immediately billed $100 more per night for 3 nights, 3 days worth of parking at $23/day and an $18/day resort fee. Surprise!! I didn't have a choice in the matter because they hit my card with all of it right then and there. I advised him I would be speaking with a manager the following morning. Surprise again! No manager was available all 3 days! \n\nI left the front desk to find our room. And it was the worst hunt I had ever been on in my life. It took 30 minutes to find the room and the little river that runs through the atrium smelled something horrible. After wandering through the jungle we emerged in the Delta Region. I think that is somewhere in South Africa, but I'm unsure. Onto the next adventure! We were told 1 room number but our keys said another. Since I was advised verbally, we chose that one. Keys didn't work. Tried the one on the card and voil\u00e0, the doors opened: to a horribly small room with 2 double beds which had a peculiar odor to it. Now for the luggage. We used the \"Consider it Done\" button on the phone (which by the way I believe it said Consider it Done OUR Way, but I could be mistaken). The bellhop brought the luggage 25 minutes later. I think he got lost too. It's now 2:00AM and time to hit the hay and see Nashville! \n\nAt 8:30AM someone is brutally banging on our door. By the nature of the banging I would have thought it to be the Feds! Apparently Housekeeping doesn't pay attention to the little guitar shaped \"Do Not Disturb\" card. I'm awake now...and I want coffee! The coffee maker doesn't work. The iron didn't work. Ok. There's a cafe somewhere amongst the foliage! I saw it marked on the map. They should probably include a legend on said map. $8 for an overpriced knockoff Starbucks, but ok, it's Nashville and a local tourist trap. \n\nI'm going to fast-forward a little as to not make this much longer. Despite the pools not being open when they say they are, the restaurants being more expensive than those in airports and with mediocre food at best, being kicked out of the pizza place they had inside 10 minutes before closing and our room had an amazing view of dumpsters with the glorious rolling landscape of a parking lot, it was a nice place! The only saving grace were the gardens themselves. But you can view them without having to pay for a room! \n\nNow for the really fun part: Contacting Marriott Customer Care about the horrible visit. (The hotel won't call you back otherwise.) Customer Care advised me they would forward my grievance to the hotel and I should expect a response in 3-5 business days. I forwarded everything I could think of including my original reservation, costs, incorrect information and of course the issues we had while staying there. \n\nI was eventually contacted by a Heather Gates who is the Assistant Front End Manager. She informed me she was sorry for the way we were treated but they would not do anything to rectify the bill. That's the way it was. I contacted Marriott Customer Care again and copied Heather on this email. I was then phoned by John Bennefield, the Front End Manager who informed me the exact same thing as Heather \"Sorry, but you're stuck with that bill.\" Furthermore he refused to give me the hotel manager's name, phone or email. Instead I was informed of his 15 years with the company and this was his 8th hotel! From working in a large company, when someone was transferred so frequently, we called it \"Passing the Trash\". It definitely wasn't due to pride of service. John was exceptionally rude and went on to belittle me for making such a huge deal and contacting customer care over a mere $300. To me, that's reasonably substantial. I was also informed directly that \"The Marriott considers this matter closed. It ends here and there's nothing more anyone will do.\" I had asked for the hotel managers number, name or email to which he told me \"you can find it online\".", "date": "2015-09-02 23:24:51"}

I've been to dozens of Japanese restaurants all over the US and Hawaii - this one is the best, by far.  Unbelievable!\nFABULOUS food.  Millions of options for vegetarians and vegans.  I don't remember the name of the veg sushi I had as an appetizer, but when it came out it was hard to eat because it was pure artistry.  What a gorgeous plate!  The individual rolls were arranged around a giant swirled design of sauces in 4 or 5 bright colors - the most beautiful presentation I've ever seen anywhere.  If I remember correctly, the rolls included sweet potato, some other veggies, rice, and all topped by a slice of ripe mango.  WOW.  \nI also enjoyed a veggie dish with big, fat Udon noodles.  Delicious!  \nGreat seaweed salad - one of my test plates at any Japanese restaurant.\nMy friend had raw fish sushi and a fried rice with meat...  He kept saying \"Oh my God...\"  every time he tried something whether it was what he ordered or one of my choices.  He is a world traveler and he lives in Chicago - the man knows good food!\nI can't close without mentioning the prices.  How low can you go???  Incredible - and this is NOT a chain, thank goodness.  Support your independents!!!  Also, enormous portions and a giant menu so nobody will be unhappy.\nAmple free parking - this place is in a small strip mall.\nLovely restrooms, in keeping with the whole restaurant.\nSuper service!  Everyone was of Asian descent, and each person had a friendly smile.  Our server was a wonderful young woman who was on-the-spot with beverage refills and plate removal.  \nIf you've all but given up on a perfect restaurant experience in Indianapolis, this place WILL change your mind.", "date": "2010-10-13 13:07:37"}

You can also watch hockey/figure skating/curling/public skating in person while dining or having a drink. Then if all of that watching gets you motivated you can go and do it at the same place! \n\nThere is a full bar including many craft beers and the owners very own tap of 81bay's beers. There is also many other local Tampa brews on tap! \n\nAs for the food, many are surprised that this is not your average sports food there is a nice diversity and there are many healthy options and divulgent options too for any diet or preference. The food may take a bit longer wait than expected but that is only because almost everything is made fresh from scratch in the kitchen. There is a snack bar owned by the same owners downstairs in the rink if you are more in a hurry.\n\nTheir menu has influences like Ybor City for the Ybor Eggrolls, Canadian Hockey traditional Poutine dishes, and a Tampa Bay Lightning Bleu Burger. They have a small kids menu and the whole restaurant including the bar is Kid-friendly. The chef is an amazing person who sometimes comes out to talk to customers as are all the staff including the owners, bartenders, hostess, servers, and kitchen staff. They also cater and are very patient and accommodating to any problems or special requests.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant!

Almost twice the size I was expecting.\nThe other roll I got was the Angry Hamachi, which included regular hamachi (yellowtail), spicy hamachi, avocado, jalapeno, cilantro, & roe.\nY'all, this roll was so fresh and balanced, I was so stinkin' happy.

Wrong.  The set up of this store is pretty similar to any other Whole Foods.  The selection, prices, etc... all of that was the same.  Here are the things that bothered me:\n\n1. Free samples- who doesn't love free samples?  It would have been nice if they had toothpicks/utensils to eat them.  And some of that stuff looked like it had been sitting there for hours.\n\n2. Cashiers- generally speaking, I think this is where Whole Foods (and Trader Joes) really differentiates themselves from other grocery stores.  As we approached the cash registers, 3 of them were open, but didn't have anyone working them.  Evidently all of them were having a rousing conversation at the third person's station.  \n\nWhen we finally managed to get the attention of one of them, we got down to business.  After my wife had paid, the cashier handed her the receipt, but began takling to the bagger (who showed up after the fact) about an order she needed processed.  My wife stood there, not sure if she needed to sign, or if she was all good.  The bagger actually had to ask the cashier if we were good to go, to which she replied a hasty \"oh, yeah.\"  \n\nOVERALL- Whole Foods- you really let me down on this one.

But apparently, it seems that is not the case. I have been to their Northeast Philadelphia location, so I decided to try out this other location in South Street. It is metered street parking everyday up to 10pm, so make sure that you feed that meter during that time. It is not handicap accessible. Bathrooms are located down the stairs in the basement. I have to tell you though as you walk down the steps, you can't help but notice the stench of urine in the air. They really need to do a thorough cleaning of their bathrooms and hallways. Our server greeted us and was friendly when we arrived. The bartender also acknowledged us as we were seated in a booth. Seating is limited. I noticed though that the open floor area around the bar is very spacious. I presume that they prefer to accommodate the standing room only for bar patrons rather than dining in customers? It is impossible to have a conversation going with your group because they have the tv volume blasting out very loud and tuned  to the Phillies game going on. The Cheeseburger sliders had no dressing whatsoever. The bun was dry, the patty was dry and lacked flavor. Caesar Salad was so-so, nothing special. The Shepherd's Pie was very oily. Oil coming from the ground meat? Apparently, the type of ground meat they used had the ratio of more fat than lean? The Kilkenny Chocolate Cake with Vanilla ice cream was the only dish that is delicious. I am disappointed at our visit to this establishment.

The brunch menu is pretty limited which I think hurts Mr. B's more than it helps. No omelettes or egg white options. Not even a made to order omelette option. \n\nWe had:\n\nCrab cake app -- packed.

The atmosphere feels very L.A. The white and black decor is perfect. What I don't appreciate is the parking situation. My first time parking in the deck, I thought that I would get an hour free. I grabbed the ticket from the station and parked (it's very narrow and cramped FYI) on the 3rd floor. The parking spaces are not generous nor are the compact spaces truly *compact.* So, whomever your parking company is, however closely affiliated, there should be better customer service reps available to communicate that you HAVE TO VALIDATE your parking. Clear signage would be much appreciated. I'm a pretty observant person and there may have been one sign anywhere in the vicinity. Most places simply note that you've selected an hour and you don't have to reenter the ticket or it notes your \"in and out\" times and doesn't charge you for less than an hour. This is a fault that is easy to fix. Also, the attendant was less than friendly when I told him it was my first time parking there and if he could make this one exception since the place was right there - he said \"Nope. Nothing I can do\" and just waited for one of us, my co-worked or myself to pay $3.00 when we were there for 45 minutes. It wouldn't read my card w/ a chip but did read hers which also had a chip. Attendants shouldn't be rude or unhelpful. \n\nTherefore, in busy places like Nashville, you are only as good as your parking. That gets more people to you on a regular basis and also return customers. If it is difficult to get to you - then you'll suffer. Regardless, this business will most likely flourish but the parking company may get replaced. I'll be back, but I doubt when I have to park there.", "date": "2017-11-10 19:25:07"}

The glowing references are well deserved based on our experience. \n\nWe were greeted and seated immediately at six thirty on a Saturday night. No reservations were no problem, but that may have been a function of the time of year - pre Thanksgiving. The menu was true to what we'd seen on line, but the specials that Jay went over made us reconsider. We ordered a bottle of the Castillo (garnacha) which was deftly opened and poured for tasting. A very nice, big, red, great value, and stands up to garlic!\n\nStarted with sharing the escargot and we both really liked the grated/melted cheese and copious fresh garlic combination.\n\nThe salad that came with was fresh and the vinagrette dressing was balanced and quite sufficient.\n\nMy wife had the lamb kebabs, because I don't/can't cook lamb at home. She loved them and was especially taken with the fresh local french style green beans.

The establishment itself is a marked difference from the environment.  Just outside the door, you are immediately approached my smiling, welcomed faces that introduce you to a cool and relaxing atmosphere.  There is a low ceiling and wide floor design, much like you would see in the old style of buildings in the area.  It's a bit confusing, but unless you are used to this type of service, you are a little thrown of who your server even is, you are asked how you are and can I get you started by a few people, you can't help but feel lost at first.\n\nOnce our server was identified we instantly got started; the meals chosen were:\n* Braised Rabbit- (5 Stars) This meal was a delight to eat, the rabbit was ultra tender and with it being mixed with grilled onion and garlic-mashed potatoes; it took it to heights that most are unable to achieve.  My wife and daughter kept sneaking forkfuls of my dish, yet prior to ordering they thought I was nuts for ordering the rabbit.\n* Shrimp and Grits- (4 Stars) My wife's plate, she loved it but claimed that the rabbit had so much more flavor that it couldn't be compared.  I myself tasted the shrimp and grits and found it to be far more superior to the \"shrimp dishes\" that are being claimed as great around the French Quarter; though, I did think my plate was tastier.  The shrimp being wrapped with bacon gave the texture of the shrimp a mouth watering feeling for more.  The grits were so smooth, cheesy and complementary to the shrimp that it makes me wish they had larger portions.\n* Seafood Gumbo- (3 Stars) My daughters dish, although my wife and I had a couple of spoonful's and I agree with my daughters assessment of the flavor......it was lacking.   We have tried other gumbos in the area and found this one to be less inviting.  The serving size was not hot at all and the clear question was, \"where's the seafood?\" It was missing in action and sorely missed. \n* The desserts were- (5 Stars), in order of greatness, Lemon Ice Box Pie, Peach Cake and Profiteroles and Chocolate Sauce.  Lets just put it this way, spoons all around that table were flying with collision happening in midflight attempting to nab more of the others dessert.  Desserts are under appreciated at Mr. B's, probably because everyone is full by the time their server comes around to ask if they had \"any room left for dessert\". \nMy only big negative about the restaurant is the placement of the tables.  It leaves the patrons exposed to rushing servers zooming by to perform their duties while they inadvertently bump you or your chair.  Mr. B's will not disappoint but it will not make you feel WOWED either.  Would I eat here again, if given a chance? YES and I would happily suggest it to a friend but the quarter here is large enough to indulge elsewhere as well.", "date": "2014-07-16 03:17:07"}

Actually, I decided to hit up the library then walk over to a restaurant on Oak St...but when I got to Oak St, my chosen restaurant was closed. Ouch. So I just kept walking. Saltwater Grill showed up in front of me when everything else was closed or boring or meat-centric so here we go. \n\nMy food was great: I had the Saltwater Salad sans bacon (chosen because another Yelper posted favorably about it!) and a grilled artichoke. The salad was solid, but the artichoke was just astounding. I can't even describe how fantastic it was without drooling. This is the first time I've encountered a grilled artichoke so I'm not quite sure how to evaluate beyond \"yum, good, me likey.\" I will say that I got the WHOLE artichoke so if you are not a fan of eating the meat off the petals, skip it. \n\nMy drink was always topped up; and the kitchen held my salad until I was done with the artichoke instead of crowding my table or rushing me. I can see how service would get sloppy when it gets busy, but the service was spot-on for 3p on a Monday. \n\nI'm coming back, and I'm bringing a date next time. \n\nUmmm, also, this place had the weirdest restroom I've ever seen. \n\nAccessibility notes: Fully accessible for mobility devices.

I'd like to first respond by suggesting that you take someone's review based on a restaurant week experience with a grain of salt.  Seriously...  it's restaurant week, and you're someone who wants to be a hip, know-it-all foodie for 1 week but otherwise orders out for pizza.\n\nI've eaten here many many (emphasis on many) times and have never been disappointed with the food.  If you want to be sure that they don't prepare the food & leave it under the heat lamp for ages, as one reviewer speculated, just look in the little circular window as you walk in and watch them make it. There are no secret cover-ups. \n\nLunch is pretty busy, since the restaurant is located on the 4th floor of an interior design building and there really aren't a lot of other places in the immediate area, but the sandwiches  are such a great alternative to the typical hoagie fare.   \nmy lunch favorite: Cocotte - white meat chicken salad with grapes, basil, apple, walnuts, celery and dijon mayonnaise on pita bread.\n\nThe salads are large and there's a diverse selection.. not just garden salad vs. caesar, but some unique and creative combinations and they are definitely satisfying on their own.\n\nGet the sweet potato fries!\n\nDinner time is almost never crowded. You probably don't need a reservation unless it's a special event. Ask to sit by a window, the views (in either room) are incredible. You get the river with the bridge lit up at night, 30th street station and, though it's better to see during the day, the art museum. The lack of crowds mean you can have an intimate conversation with your guests comfortably.\n\nPatrice is amazing. It is not often that the owner/chef of a restaurant will come out during dinner to go table to table and ask if everything is OK. His accent will also make you melt, which is always a plus for me.\n\nI think it's usually empty because of its location. There is not much around and it can be a little shady at night time, but if you can quickly shuffle a couple blocks to Chestnut or Walnut, you're back in the mix of it all again, safe and sound.", "date": "2010-03-26 03:57:11"}

I had not yet been to Tomo and it was floating on my wish list for several months, so I made it a priority.  \nRemember that scene in Wizard of Oz where Dorothy catches a glimpse of Munchkinland for the first time?   That was kind of the same thing here.   I went from a fairly nondescript strip mall up on Keystone to the magical and mysterious interior of Tomo.    Ok, it wasn't the same as going from black and white to color, but it was in the same neighborhood.   \nThe service was outstanding and I felt at ease the whole time I was there.  \nI went with a straightforward sushi lunch with a variety of sushi offerings with a delicious salad to start me off.  Having mostly enjoyed \"Supermarket Sushi\" for the past 6 months or so, it was nice to be able to take those tastes to the next level - there is a difference when the sushi isn't trapped in a little plastic box with little plastic grass.   \nAll in all, a wonderful experience.   The meal was a great value at lunch and I can't say enough about the service.   As evidenced by the many smiling pictures of patrons on the wall as you walk in, I'm not alone in my review of Tomo.  \nI will be back!", "date": "2011-12-07 17:26:32"}

We'd already ordered some wine/drinks, so I figured he'd be willing to give us some decent service in hopes of a decent tip. The guy returned 7 or so mins later with some chips. I guess the guy gave us something to talk about, and he did try and hustle a bit more later in the evening. ***\n\nMy boys tried a mixed variety from the menu. Their only complaint came from a wrap.

What we found was a pleasant but inattentive server and bus boys that seemed to be clueless.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had the poached pear salad.  The flavor was very good on the pears but for $8.50 I wanted more than 4 thin slices.  it was supposed to have smoked Gouda.  I think there was 6 pieces that appeared to be box shredded.  I could not find the craisins or walnuts and the greens were starting to turn brown.  My husband had the wedge salad.  Again, over priced for the quality and amount.  I had, as an entree, the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes.  They had no flavor.  The mashed potatoes had a lump of cheddar in the center and were overpowered by Old Bay seasoning.  My husband had the Seafood Pescatore which he said was OK.  I will say the desserts where beyond excellent.  We were told they were homemade so KUDOS to the baker.  We shared a Chocolate Mint Torte.  My mouth waters thinking about it.  The server, while she was pleasant, came over to take our order and then we did not see her again until she gave us our bill.  We asked for flatware as our food was served with no implements to eat it with.  Had we had the set ups at arrival we may have had a luke warm rather than cold meals.

So I tried to get back in and the door was locked so I told the guy from the open window that I heard what he said and i thought it was rude! His reply was I couldn't believe you thought we were open, the chairs were on the table and the door was locked. I replied by saying that I walked right in and I had never been here before, there were customers eating also. Anyway he follows me out and says what is your problem. He never apologized or anything.

We have never had a good experience with service or food but it is usually fine enough for its convenient location- would have given it about 2.5 to 3 stars. However, our last experience was truly the worst dining experience we have ever had. Momos offered a groupon that was expiring in a couple days and was therefore over crowded. We waited 35 minutes to get a table on a Monday night. When we finally got a table we ordered quickly and waited on the food. We ordered an appetizer (bacon wrapped olives) and 2 main dishes (kabobs). We waited 45 minutes and still no food had come. People around us were getting food even though they had been seated after us. We had also not seen our waitress since she had taken our order. Finally, a chef brought out one of the kabobs. We still had not gotten our appetizer or the other main dish. We continued to wait until another server came over and asked us what we were waiting on. We explained what else we had ordered and she hurried off. \n\nThen, finally, our waitress came back and started blaming the busyness of the restaurant on our late food. Yes it was busy - but that is no excuse to forget to put in someone's order!!! She was very rude and unapologetic!!!!! Finally, after waiting more than an hour, the first dish was cold, and they finally brought the appetizer and then twenty minutes later the other main dish. \n\nWe would have expected they would have comped us or something, but when we got the bill - FULL PRICE! To top it off, the food was disgusting, tasteless, and cold. We will never eat here again and recommend to stay away in case they are \"too busy\" to remember to put in your order. Obviously that sort of thing happens - but servers are usually apologetic and give you your food for free. To summarize - worst dining experience we have ever had. Will not return.", "date": "2013-01-08 02:18:34"}

I would have liked more meat in my biryani (after all, it did cost $19 for an admittedly very large portion).  There were a couple tiny patches of unseasoned rice in there but they did not detract from the dish at all. The korma was what you'd expect and plenty tasty. Naan was kind of thin and came out before the rest of the meal. Bummer, I'd hoped to eat it with the other dishes. My younger son ordered mango lassi which took forever to get there but was gigantic, tasted good, and served in a kind of volumetric flask that was cool to look at. I think the reason I'm giving Taj Mahal 3 stars is the timing of the meal (naan early, lassi late, everything took a long time despite the restaurant being pretty empty) and price-to-meat ratio of the biryani.

The space is tasteful, modern and upscale - the dim lighting helps create an intimate vibe and the noise level energetic but not overbearing. The staff we encountered were wonderful; friendly, efficient and helpful. The craft cocktails are thoughtful and creative with a vast, well laid out menu; they were on par with Chicago's top cocktail bars. The only oddity was it appeared all cocktails were shaken - even one's that were nearly pure booze, perhaps to put on a show. I particularly loved the rye based cocktail with Fernet Branca, coffee and Angostura bitters.The food is daring, modern and well executed; I strongly recommend the Deviled Eggs - such a cool presentation and phenomenal taste. Quality ingredients are utilized both for the cocktails (i.e. all house made mixers) and the cuisine. We chose to sit at the long bar and greatly enjoyed being able to watch and interact with the bartenders. Puck was our primary server and I loved all three of his cocktails (the name of the bartender who created each cocktail is listed on the menu; the first one of Puck's I tried was so wonderful I opted to keep choosing his creations).

Let's get down to it, this place is the most consistant I have ever experienced which is one reason I love it so much.  Not only is the food consistant, but the service is always above and beyond amazing.  I have never had a server who was a boring person with no personality. Whomever it is that waits on my table when I go is always super happy and excited to be your server. They have conversations, they of course ask where you are from, because being from New Orleans is so abnormal when dining in the French Quarter, they make jokes, they are just down right entertaining.\n\nNow on to the food and drinks.  I'll go by my most recent visit which was just a few days ago. We ordered a bottle of wine which was in my opinion a pretty reasonable $34 for a place of this quality.  Now of course I ordered Duck Spring Rolls. This is is a must do for me every time, and they are always perfect. They are a bit of Asian flavor with goat cheese, shitake, spinach and duck inside. Yummm! I also ordered the heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzerella salad, which isn't always on the menu. I was really happy I got that salad, it was so refreshing and pretty to look at too, darn I should have taken a picture! Then for my entree I ordered the scallops, which is actually an appetizer, and has two jumbo sea scallops that are buttery delicious perfection, and they are accompanied by watercress and shaved parmigiano - reggiano. The best scallops ever!!! I had a bite of my dad's enormous pork chop, it was amazing, my brother's Osso Bucco, it was amazing, my mom's veal picatta, amazing, my son's very special birthday chicken tenders, amazing!!! Dessert: bread pudding of course, in my opinion the best other than my mom's recipe.

This place is off the hook. \n\nEverything, and I mean everything, that I tried here is delicious. I knew that it would be good food based on other Yelp reviews as well as local word of mouth, but frankly I was amazed by the quality. \n\nI had the unsweetened mixed berry iced tea and could not ask for a more perfect house brewed tea. It was slightly sweet due to being infused with berries, but this was perfectly fine, and the flavors were on point. My group started with the tostones, fried mashed plantains, and they were very tasty and plentiful. One plate was enough to feed a table of four, and it came with their house made guacamole. Their guacamole has a little bit of spice to it, but nothing unbearable. \n\nFeeling drawn to the Buddha tacos I ordered them and wondered if they would be any good. Now I find it unbelievable that some of the best tacos I've ever had come from a vegetarian joint. I got them served on the blue corn Johnny cakes, and liked that they had crisp edges with a more cake-like interior. The filing my consisted primarily of sweet potatoes, avocado and peanuts. Don't let that deter you, it was a combination that was beyond delicious. I would never think to mix them but it worked! Add a little bit of lime on there and it's even better. These also come with the signature guacamole. \n\nI also got to sample some of my dining partners' foods, all of which were equally tasty. The ginger ramen is done well, with a nice little kick to the broth. It's true to typical Japanese style ramen while being its own unique recipe. The falafel has an interesting grainy texture (as opposed to a smooth, doughy one) but it works. Last but not least is the Velvet Verde, comprised mainly of spaghetti squash. It had a lot of particular flavors going on but it all pulled together to make a tasty dish. \n\nI can't wait to come back here! Now I feel like I should try everything on the menu since every dish we got was outstanding. Even if you are not a vegetarian I would still suggest trying this place just once. The food is so good you will not miss the meat.", "date": "2016-03-09 11:57:16"}

I was fortunate enough to show up when they weren't too busy and was able to chat with Ben and Jerry, two personable and engaging staff behind the bar, and a few other friendly customers. Bier's line-up tends to be on the less bitter side, which makes me extremely happy. Of the seven or eight beers I tasted, most ranged from 10-20 IBUs (International Bittering Units scale, a measurement of a beer's bitterness, with 0 as the lowest possible). Only one rated at 50 or above, and even that tasted delicious!\n\nWhen I visited a couple days ago, I picked up a growler of Weizengoot, my favorite of the seven. It had an enticing deep-orange hue and looked simply fantastic. The first sip tasted faintly like Blue Moon, but the finish felt closer to Hoegaarden -- an excellent combination, yet still wonderfully unique. Since I had to share, the growler lasted less than an hour! I stopped into Bier again this afternoon -- Sunday growler sales in Indiana are a beautiful thing! -- but was mildly disappointed to discover  that Bier had already sold out of the Goot. Blast! \n\nInstead, I chose my second favorite -- Chamomille Wheat. Another delicious wheat beer, somehow light-tasting yet full-bodied? Yes, please. The growler is now nearly empty... and I didn't have to share this time!\n\nWhile the prices ($12-14 for a fill) are just a touch high (I'm spoiled by $6-9 fills), they're well worth it for such fantastic beer -- and for supporting such a great, up-and-coming small business. They're such relative newcomers, their beer is only sold on the premises -- you can't buy it in any bars or stores, but I imagine that will quickly change once word gets out and they're able to ramp up production.\n\nIn short, I can't wait to go back to Bier. Next time, I'll be bringing two or three growlers with me!", "date": "2011-03-27 23:22:41"}

The food is good and verbally the device is good as well. However, tonight's visit in was a bit confusing...\n\nI entered the restaurant around 5:45pm, and upon entering there were three people seated inside, a couple in the back corner eating and a lady at the bar eating. Standing there for about 30 seconds or so, unsure if I should wait to be seated or seat myself, a woman in the back of the restaurant started yelling something towards the front of the place. I thought I did something wrong. \n\nShe yelled something again and the guy in the corner turned and looked at me and went back to eating, once more she yelled and then he finally got up confused looking and started walking to the woman at the bar... and again the lady in the back yelled, he finally seems to notice me, and as he looked at me, confused, he said \"oh?\". At this point I looked at him and said: \"Just one please\". He still seemed confused as to why he was helpin me but told me to just sit anywhere. He followed me to the table and gave me a menu. Then immediately walked away.\n\nA minute or two later he came back to get my drink order, to which I ordered water. When he returned with the drink he sat the water down with the woman at the bar, she said \"this isn't for me, I think that's his drink.\" Pointing at me...\n\nHe then smiled and was like \"oh yeah.\" Picking the drink back up and bringing it to me. He then just stood there, not saying anything - I took this as my queue to order so I pointed to what I wanted and said that I also wants to add an egg roll. Fairly quickly the food came out. Thankfully he not only brought the food to me but he also brought me the right food, with one exception - no egg roll. But after quickly setting it food down he darted outside for about 10'minutes - I believe he was trying to bring in customers who were walking by as he finally returned inside with a small group of people. \n\nAt this point he takes care of their order then brings me a check. $30 with a soda, beer, and two meals on it, and again goes right back outside before I can even pick the ticket up to look over it. Not in a rush I waited a bit, sipped my water. He returned 6-8 minutes later and comes to collect the check. I tell him it's the wrong check.\n\nHe smiles and apologizes and comes back with another check. This time it had the correct meal but also had a $2.50 charger for a soft drink, to which I pointed down at my cup of water and told him that I only had a water and that there was a soda charge on the bill. He grabs it back and looks at it for a few seconds and then says he will be right back. \n\nAt this point he finally brings the right check, my card was still in my hand but he darted off again before I could hand it back to him. So  walked up to the bar, near the register and stood there for about 5 minutes before someone would ring it out. At this point there were two tables with 5 total people and the woman at the bar, not a crazy rush by any standards. \n\nPaid and left... I will definitely think twice about returning, sadly.", "date": "2016-01-20 00:50:38"}

They also have roti with all different meats including shrimp and \"soya\" and other standard West Indian fare like curry goat, collard greens, etc.  Plates of those things range in price and size from about $5 up.  I am giving 4 stars just because doubles I've had in the past were a little more substantial, and they could have been spicier (though they were well-spiced, just not hot). The thing I was most disappointed by was  the subpar ginger-pineapple juice I got for $3.  $3!?

Let's start with the decor. What I learned is that it is the largest hotel in the country with no casino, so this place as you can imagine is immense, and very confusing. Although you get the lay of the land at some point, every different section of the hotel looks exactly the same. So although you may be in The Cascades lobby Vs. The Garden Conservatory it's all the exact same indoor \"bio-dome\" as we came to call it. At first I enjoyed the indoor/outdoor theme of the hotel. Waterfalls, koi ponds, rivers with boats....wait a boat? Yes that's right there is a boat tour around the \"delta river.\" This was my first confused moment. This place is like Disney meets the MGM grand, meets a bio dome, meets a convention center. Real flowers and trees, fake rocks with music emanating from them. The indoor/outdoor thing started to become a little uncanny and I was happy they had two outdoor pools to choose from. The pool in Cascades I very much enjoyed, plenty of chairs to lounge all day and a big enough space to feel like you are in your own little world. Food and drink service available, and a hot tub, if the Nashville sun isn't heating you up enough. BUT let me tell you about the food in this place. If you are going to create a hotel where you intend me to never leave, please feed me well. Although we didn't try the steak house, which they say is the best, I tried almost everything else and it was near inedible. Solerio the Mexican restaurant gets a star, if that. Cascades, also gets one star if I must, i couldn't believe how rude one of the staff was one day, and the sushi place Wasabi's is passable, although I ate vegetarian. This place was an interesting place to stay, certainly stimulating, but it got a little old. And if you stay here make other arrangements for food, you will be upset at your empty wallet and stomach.", "date": "2011-08-29 18:03:17"}

First, the positive.  This place is absolutely GORGEOUS!!!   It feels like Hawaii!  I can't say enough good things about how beautiful it is inside.  The plants, waterfalls and natural light are just amazing.  The reason I am giving it only two stars is because of the service and COST.  Our room was not ready at check-in (after waiting over half an hour in line).  Since we arrived before 4:00 we had to come back to get the room key which required waiting another half an hour in the \"key pick up\" line.  Lots of waiting.  Lots of lines.  They charge you extras for EVERYTHING!  ...parking..resort fees etc.  The room isn't cheap to begin with but then you add on all these extra fees and taxes.  Be prepared that you will pay a lot more than the quoted room rate when you are booking (which is not cheap either!).  On our most recent visit, when we finally got to our room we brought in the bags that we were carrying and then made a quick trip to the car to get our luggage.  When we got back to the room (15 minutes later - max!) someone from housekeeping had been in and for some reason completely stripped the beds!  It was so strange!  When we originally got to our room it was obviously clean, beds made, so I have no idea why they would have done this.  It took over half an hour for someone to respond to our call.  Then after housekeeping did arrive they took another half hour to bring sheets and make the beds.  All this after all the waiting to check in!  Bottom line, this place is stunning but know what you're getting into in terms of cost.  I just like everything to be upfront and I feel like when there are all these hidden fees, it feels slightly deceptive to me or something.  For our family of four, two nights cost us just under $1,000 with all the charges and some meals.   Despite the 2 star review I probably would stay here again because I just love how beautiful the inside is and we love Nashville!", "date": "2017-03-29 13:48:43"}

As others have said, the location was strange and kind of unfortunate.  The building is mainly a design complex for home decor.  We followed signs throughout the building leading us up to the 4th floor.  We were greeted by an incredibly friendly waitress who took our coats and introduced us to the French chef and owner.  She then led us through a cozy seating area to the far dining room overlooking the Schuylkill River and 30th St Station.  The chrome wall behind the bar reflected the reds and blues of the neon sign and logo in the window giving off a modern vibe.  \n\nWe had chosen it for the restaurant week menu which we'd read online... we ordered some cocktails and double checked our choices from the menu.  An added first course was brought out to us- truffle mushroom soup.  Neither of us actually like mushrooms much, but both enjoyed the light, creamy soup quite a bit.  His appetizer of lobster stuffed calamari was a bit tough, though he easily ate it all anyway. My  eggplant dish was phenomenal.  For the main course, the bf had chicken and I chose striped bass.  We each loved our own dish and liked the other's.  Our desserts were creme brulee (fantastic, I thought, though the boy would've preferred it slightly warmer) and an apple pie tart (quite good I thought, the boy loved).  \n\nOverall, it was a great choice.  We would never have found it if not for restaurant week, and we'd definitely go back in the future.

Nice big chunks of artichokes and the tomatoes had a nice char from the oven, lending a nice burst of sweetness to each bite. Just yummy.\nThey have a good grasp on balancing the amount of each topping just right. Not too much of any one thing and it all works together. The salads are also enjoyable as is the spinach and artichoke dip. Will be back for more soon. ....got my eye on the saltimbocca for next time. \nOh and delivery was incredibly fast.

Friendly bartender and servers, but the bartender was our server and as the place got busier she didn't tell the other servers to check on us so wait time was a bit long.  The drinks were good and strong, a little pricey, but understood as it's in a hotel.  Were good about us taking our drinks to our room when we were ready.

So we decided to go back and have a nice dinner.  The place was crowded and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  Once seated our server took our order which was a main entr\u00e9e and a side salad.  In about 5 to 10 minutes we received our salads.  Everything was going just fine; we finished our salads and were enjoying the bread and wine.  \n\nAfter some time we realized we had drank two glasses of wine and finished the bread, but had not received our entr\u00e9e.  Our waiter never came by to check on us or explain why it was taking so long to get our entr\u00e9e.  So we asked the manager if she could check our order.  Come to find out the waiter never placed our order! \n\nWe sat there for an hour eating salad, bread and wine and our order was never entered.  We were giving the place the benefit of the doubt that they were busy and had gotten backed-up in the kitchen. We even over heard the table next to us ask our same waiter why it was taking so long to get their order.  We just did not realize how much time had passed until we ran out of conversation.  Wow!  The level of incompetence at this place is extraordinary. \n\nThe manager was very apologetic.  She was embarrassed at the level of service we received and made no excuses.  She of course comp our meal and offered to expedite the order so we could eat.  However, there is no excuse for this type of mistake.  Hiring staff that are incompetence is unacceptable.

The bad thing is, b/c it is the same as the rest, it may be hard to find something you've never tried before- but their cheese cakes looked to be their stand apart from other bakeries.

But the pool areas are really well done and perfect for the little ones...ours really enjoyed herself. \n\nIf you prepare yourself to be price-gouged on everything, it can be quite a nice experience.

Naturally, the Bird and Pig - which features chicken, bacon, apple, brie and agave nectar.   It was definitely sweet.  And savory.  And absolutely, positively to die for.  I loved every scrumptious bite of it.... except for the dry chicken breast.  I'm not sure if it was just old, but either way it was dry and disappointing.\n\nNext on the menu was the deluxe grilled cheese sandwich, which was all sorts of yummy cheese, smothering delicious garden fresh basil (wow!), spinach and tomato.   The first bite of this sandwich was knock-your-socks-off.  The basil really stands out and it definitely warranted an audible moan.  The next few bites weren't as spectacular, but I still loved the sandwich.  I'd go with the Bird and Pig again if I had to choose.\n\nWhile we waited, we treated our faces to black bean dip (suggested by the waiter) and we enjoyed it.

He was prompt and responsive and my family and I really appreciated his effort.\n\nNow to the review - the food was pretty good, when it came out correct...We are vegetarian and ordered the Brussel sprouts (without bacon), two pizzas (margharita and potato) and one pasta (arrabiata).  When the person brought the Brussel sprouts to the table, she said there was no meat...but in my first bite I had a piece of bacon. Definitely disappointed from that experience.  Luckily they paid extra attention to the rest of our order and made sure everything was correct.  I think the kitchen at this place is very overwhelmed...\n\nThis actually leads to the main reason for the 2-star review.  We made a reservation for 6 at 7:30p.  When we got there at 7:25p they told us that the had 2 other parties of 6 that needed to be seated before us and the kitchen was running behind.  We said that we had a reservation but apparently so did the other parties.  Why in the world would they book three reservations at the same time when they clearly didn't have the space/ability to accommodate?! We heard similar comments about why even make a reservation from most of the people waiting in the waiting area.  When we finally got seated...30 mins after our reservation...it was at a make shift table that was extremely tight without sufficient space for all our plates. \n\nThe food was the redeeming quality for my experience.  My brother said that he had a similar experience the last time he came here for dinner.

Even once we arrived, the small bar style dining and aroma of the day's catch inside the place was in line with the image one conjures up when thinking of fresh seafood.\n\nAfter a very brief wait, we got a seat looking directly at the kitchen, and let me tell you, the staff have this operation down to a science. They are moving people in and out of the restaurant at record speed, all without sacrificing service. Our waiter was friendly and helpful, and we never once felt rushed. In fact, this was a highlight for us. Even when selecting our beverages, he let us sample beer and made recommendations on wine. \n\nWe ordered all of our food at once, as we'd had a chance to peruse the menu and take a few tips from Yelp. We ordered a glutenfest including a cup of clam chowder, a half dozen oysters, some coconut shrimp and the shrimp and scallop linguine.\n\nThe clam chowder arrived first, and it was a bit bland. I really wanted to like it since the weather was ideal and they add bacon in every batch (!), but it was lacking something. Adding the oyster crackers helped, but I would recommend skipping this. If you are in a soup mood, maybe try the soup of the day. They had a bisque, and that might have been a better option. \n\nThe oysters arrived next, and that was the biggest letdown for me. I am an oyster junkie - I've been known to eat four dozen in one sitting. I'm also an oyster purist, meaning I add only a tiny bit of lemon before eating them so they maintain their sea flavor. The presentation was sloppy - just ice on a plate, which was melting and wet our eating area, a measly slice of lemon and lime, cocktail sauce and a little horseradish. The oysters themselves just weren't that good, and for the first time in my life, I left two on the plate when it went back.\n\nThe coconut shrimp and linguine arrived together, and they were both quite good. You know how sometimes when you get coconut shrimp, they seem to be lacking coconut? These babies were loaded with it and were large in size to boot. I think I bit into the tail on every shrimp I ate on account of the batter being so delicious. The onion ring garnish was also amazing. Maybe it's just the fact that I don't eat gluten often, but the batter on everything was outstanding.\n\nThe linguine was pretty good as the seafood was tender and the noodles were just past al dente. The sauce was a little too white winey for me, but my boyfriend loved it. Maybe it felt like too much because I was already drinking a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.\n\nAll in all, I think this was a three and a half star dining experience. Admittedly, the biggest disappointment was likely my own elevated expectations. Yelp reviews caused me to believe that the food would be spectacular, and I'd say it was just good. Seeing the aquariums of crab was also sad as they were overcrowded and all trying to escape. Maybe I've just seen Finding Nemo too many times, but I couldn't watch them. Watching the chef, however, was fun, and the shellfish coming off the grill looked delicious. It's possible that we just didn't order the right thing, so we will likely go back once more during our stay to try their specials and the lobster tacos.", "date": "2013-12-29 16:12:02"}

I also have loved their shower toiletries from the spa whereas sometimes ya know, when ya stay somewhere, the toiletries they give ya to use can be quite subpar. The only thing I would recommend is parking at the very back at the mall for FREE because there is simply absolutely no need to be paying for parking or valet here in Nashville, esp not out here lol... that's just silly. Also, definitely get an atrium side room if you can help it, you certainly won't regret it! Bring a jacket as it gets a bit cool in there as well.

We went during beer week so it was a little hectic, but we had a table outside which was nice. There's an extensive drink menu- beer, wine, cocktails, and specialty whiskey and bourbon. I had wine and my boyfriend had a beer and a cocktail. We liked all the drinks! Started with the crawfish mac n cheese and the mixed greens salad. Mac n cheese was bomb and a nice sized portion. Mixed greens were good but nothing special for the price. It weirdly had mint in it too. I got hanger steak and he got the duck breast. Good food but nothing spectacular for the price you're paying. We got 15% off food for checking into yelp and it still seemed overpriced. I probably would come for lunch or happy hour, but for dinner it's not worth the price.", "date": "2016-06-12 20:41:47"}

As for the food ribs are fall off the bone but not really that much flavor. No dry or wet rub placed prior to smoking, and heck anything can become fall off the bone if you leave it on the smoker along enough...I don't mean this to come off that harsh but I am trying to be honest. I prefer my BBQ to have some sort of bark on the exterior with a noticeable smoke ring this BBQ is absent of the bark and only a light smoke ring. As for the sides they are just a ok in my opinion.. The beans say out inside individual packaged containers so there room temp, dry, and thick. The macaroni salad was the same lukewarm and bland. I guess in a pinch it fits the bill but if your in the mood for some finger licking BBQ you might want to look elsewhere..", "date": "2015-07-20 22:59:50"}

The ma\u00eetre d' came by at that moment and asked how everything was. I mentioned the rice issue and he said that they must be scraping the bottom of the rice cooker.

The first time we met the owner who was nice and friendly and talked about the menu items. We discovered he made great wings and we have been back for pizza and wings 2 times. Today however was a huge let down. Ordered wings they were perfect however we ordered a Greek salad and had to wait over 30 minutes to get it because they had no one to make the Greek dressing and the person was on his way in. We ended up with wings before the salad. Once we got the salad it definitely was not Greek. The owner needs to study what a Greek salad is. No tomatoes, no calamata olives, too many red bell peppers which is not a GS item. No peppercinis peppers and it had boiled eggs??? Wth! absolutely no flavor. We told them them we did not like the salad it really was not good at all and let me tell you we love salad. They told us sorry but you have to pay for it. I mean we took 2 bites and sent it back, nope didnt matter bc the menu stated what was on it and that was that. They gave us $1 off. So if you order something and you do not like it..tough noogies. You bite it you bought it lol. We will not be stopping anymore. A mom and pop place like this needs customers who are happy that want to return,  but guess not. This is the second review of the help not being available to work...this business will most likely die.

Concierge and the bell service was also very pleasant as well.\n\nThe bad points:  While we were waiting for our bus back to the airport in the lobby...this lady that worked there came up to us and said \"You missed your bus.  Didn't  you hear me telling you guys to get up to get the 2pm bus?\"  We all looked at her...it was 1:45 and nobody heard her say anything.

After wandering around Society Hill and South Street, we were tired and hungry and wanted to eat somewhere decent. I had seen this place a bunch of times and thought it might be worth checking out, since they claimed that famed Three Stooges member Larry Fine was born where there restaurant now stands. \n\nWe sat outside on the patio and waited. And waited. And waited some more. Granted waiting 20 minutes for a simple hello at a restaurant, is not something I normally do. But we were starving and didn't feel like wandering around much. Nearly some thirty minutes after we sat down, we were finally acknowledged and asked what we would like to drink. The drinks then took nearly 15 more minutes to arrive, before we even got to place an order.\n\nOur food took forever to come out from the kitchen. Our server wasn't all that personable or apologetic for the slowness. She even forgot my soup that I ordered. I can't recall everything we ordered, but my sandwich was nothing special, and not all that hot as I recall. My guess is that it sat under a heat lamp for a few minutes before arriving at the table.\n\nIt took over an hour to get seated, be greeted, get a drink, and then get our food. It was much longer than I normally have waited for lackluster service and average tasting food. I wanted to ask for a manager to complain, but didn't feel like waiting another hour to find one.

I had heard good things about it and was eager to try it.\n\nArrived at 7:00 on a Friday night and got a cozy table for two. The d\u00e9cor is Mediterranean , dimly lit and cozy. This night they had an excellent acoustic guitar player entertaining. \n\nWe started with a cocktail, beer for him, tequila martini for me, while we perused the wine list. Ended up with a decent bottle of Santori Amarone ($85) which was quite good. \n\nStarted with the pate platter which come out with two nice slices of pate and all the accoutrements.  ($9.00) I love pate and this did not disappoint.\n\nWe also tried the special tuna trio of the night, a smoked tuna spread on crostini, tuna sashimi and tuna crudo. All very good and fresh although the spread was just kind of a glammed up tuna salad. \n\nFor dinner, after much debate, we went with the Paella for him and the Beef Shortribs for me. The Paella ($29) . we requested it to be crispy (as a true paella should be) and the chef obliged. Unfortunately it made the Paella so dry and overcooked it was not good at all. The shortribs, ($26) with a cabernet barbque sauce was very good. Served with a mini au gratin and fresh asparagus. The ribs were nice and tender \n, the sauce was almost bordering on overdone, almost but not quite. \n\nFor dessert we ordered our fav limencello cake, it was good, but not as good as the craft in St Pete . Ended up at the bar for a couple glasses of Port to quell our dessert craving and get a chance to listen to the guitarist. \n\nWhile at the bar we were speaking of our dinners and before you knew it Chef Karim came out to speak with us, apologized for the Paella and told us next time we come in to ask for him personally so he can take care of us. \n\nYou can tell he's a chef/owner that really cares about his clientel.

I prefer to go here for lunch. You really can't beat a salad, main dish, and a side of pasta for $8.95. \n\nThe portions are reasonable, I'm always able to finish what I ordered and I leave feeling full. Proper portioning gets an A+ from me and Gordon Ramsey. \n\nOn my most recent visit, which was at lunch, I had veal and peppers. It's a dish I typically lean towards because it's a classic that I can't make at home. I was a bit disappointed that there was only a few chunks of veal on the plate and the rest was shredded into the sauce. I didn't order a veal meat sauce, so I really did expect veal pieces. That being said, I've had it where it's been all chunks of veal. The red sauce, or gravy, or tomato sauce, or whatever they call it- I'm too Polish to understand the Italian naming of a simple tomato based sauce- is spectacular. I really do think they have one of the best sauces around. It's the reason I order the veal and peppers. No way would I be able to make a sauce so flavorful. \n\nI've also had some bad experiences with the wait staff. Sometimes they don't ask if you want pasta or vegetables as your side- during my most recent visit I was assigned pasta while the rest of my table was asked which they would prefer. Sometimes, like today, they forget to refill beverages. One time, the waitress actually told my boyfriend that he shouldn't order a sandwich and directed him to something she believed would be better. Granted, she told us she never actually tried one of the sandwiches, but loved the chicken entrees. In my mind that's completely unprofessional. \n\nThis place isn't the best in terms of decor or wait staff, but for the price and the quality of the food it is worth every experience. I really believe it's run to cater to corporate workers going out to lunch. I've found that lunch is what they're good at and there's always a lot of people obviously who came from the office.", "date": "2015-06-23 00:39:49"}

Holy frijoles batman, what a delicious fiery exotic blend of complex layered flavors with a bit of sweetness - my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  \n\nWhen they brought us each a giant stone bowl of rice I thought, \"yea like I will eat this huge bowl of rice\" - well guess what, I did and wished I had more, the way the rice gets crispy in the bowl is sooo good.\n\nSome side dishes were yummy; most notably the marinated tofu & peppers, spicy zucchini and some kind of smoky bean sprouts, others less so.  \n\nWe had a sort of embarrassing oops.  We had ordered the mushroom Soon Du Bu and I whined until hubby rolled his eyes and agreed to order it with a spiciness of only \"3\" (there have been waaaay too many times we ordered things in Asian restaurants \"very spicy\" that ended up being inedible to me, I mean, I like spicy but not \"oh my gawd my mouth is on fire, my tongue is numb, my eyeballs are blood red\" spicy like him!).  \n\nBut when we got the dish I reluctantly agreed we should have gotten it spicier.   Somehow they picked up our body language and asked what was wrong - we told them we wished we had gotten it hotter.  Thirty seconds later a woman came bustling over and indicated she could make it hotter for us and we happily nodded yes.  We waited and waited for it to come back, wondering what was taking so long - surely they just had to throw a few more spices in?  The dish came back no spicier but it was scalding hot - all I can imagine is some overworked chef in the back being asked to heat up even hotter a dish that had already been served to us literally still boiling - eep!\n\nWhen the bill came - $23 for a groaning table full of tea and food - we almost felt guilty - so much goodness for so little money.", "date": "2011-09-26 19:43:23"}

The staff was very welcoming and was happy to push together several tables for us. Our server was so nice and helpful and cheerfully took a group photo for us (annoying bloggers).\n\nThe \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere at The Bricks is fun and eclectic, with local art for sale lining the walls. I loved the laid-back, hip feeling of the place.\n\nI had the \"brick,paper,scissors\" martini and it was so refreshing and delicious that I had to get a second with my entree. The table shared an order of the \"bricklayer\" nachos and they were okay, but the house-made salsa on the side was out of this world. For my entree I got the \"bird and pig\", based on so many great Yelp recommendations. It did not disappoint with thick, crispy bacon, sweet apples and agave nectar, tasty chicken and delicious pressed \"sweet\" bread. I almost caved in and got the Ahi tuna BLT because it looked so good on the menu...I'll definitely be back and try that next time to compare.\n\nThank you Bricks for hosting our meet-up.

Given that seafood is abundant in the wharf areas, and that my company and I had worked up an appetite running around the beach, I opted to bring is here. \n\nFirst, the company I was with could brighten any day, so mood did not really affect this perspective. Second, wine was poured so that also improved the spirits. However, there were some not-to-be overlooked flaws and shortcomings to this place. \n\nThe menu is a bit confusing. Should I look at the menu or the chalkboard ahead of me, or the random appetizers haphazardly scattered around the place on small chalkboards? This made it very hard for us to make orders that were of sound judgement. But we persevered. \n\nOysters (blue & local). Flavorful, fresh, very poorly shucked. Not a single one I had was cleaned properly of grit. Additionally, many large chunks of shell were common in each one. Really not pleasant, but they were so rushed, who cares?\n\nRock crab (their specialty) was tasty, though probably less than ~3lbs quoted. Yet it was hard to compare against the size of the enormous spider crabs being hacked to bits through the window. There's very little that can be incorrect about the preparation of this item. Served with butter an cocktail sauce and a number of wipes. \n\nAbalone. Served fried over tomato rice pilaf of a sort. It was reminiscent of a risotto, but that's neither here nor there. The abalone was tender enough, lightly breaded, and tasty. It was probably the best item, but something we ordered after we noticed it in some tiny corner of the blackboard. It was difficult to get the waiter back to make the order. \n\nOverall, the meal was fine. However, the constant negative chatter from the unseated guests piling up behind us and shoved into the entranceway was unappealing. They were hungry and irritated by the lack of service. Commenting about what we were eating and how long it was taking. But the restaurant did nothing to deal with the massive crowd.

This confusion extends to the kitchen, wherein the recent chef switcheroo of Michael Stevenson for Leo Forneas has led to the restaurant's refocus from the pure Southern bourbon and blues motif that previously and not very successfully defined them since opening a few years ago.\n\nOn a normal day, this would be enough in itself, but I chose to visit during Mother's Day, pretty much the worst day for dining out, especially when you're part of a party of eight. So the service, while not bad, per se, gets a pass. What doesn't get a pass is the prix fixe menu from which we were forced to order. The menu consisted of literally every item of their normal brunch menu, plus a couple of desserts, for a significantly higher price than normal. So say you wanted to order the salad and buttermilk chicken sandwich - $15 on a normal Sunday. $35 on Mother's Day. But you got a choice of beignets or panna cotta for dessert, so I'm sure that warranted the extra markup. Needless to say, I made it a priority to choose the absolute most expensive things on their normal brunch menu.\n\nAnother problem with just throwing your entire menu onto a prix fixe is portion sizes. My tuna tartare was simply mixed with the occasional sliced cornichon and served alongside a few potato chips, but it was fresh and a good size to prime to palate for the rest of the meal. Some of my fellow diners got the pigs in a blanket, which were nearly a main course in themselves. After plowing through a few of them, multiple people remarked at how full they were getting, and the main course hadn't even arrived yet. \n\nThe Maryland Crab cake eggs benedict isn't what you'd expect to find in a Southern-slanted restaurant, but I'm glad it's here, because the crab cakes were almost all crab, and went really well with the eggs (poached well for me, though others weren't so lucky), mustard hollandaise, and English muffin. Serving them alongside french fries seemed like they just didn't want to take the time to prepare an additional starch, and I didn't want to take the time to eat the underwhelming slices of potato. \n\nFried dough is an easy crowd pleaser, and the beignets hit the spot, even if they were still a little doughy. The gluten-free diner amongst us described her panna cotta as \"interesting,\" and not in a good way, though she seemed unfamiliar with the dish. \n\nTo be honest, the combination of food and company provided an overall positive experience at Twisted Tail, though there were enough missteps to not make it a priority to return. Regardless of the good service from our server, and the great service from the managers in seating us in what must have been a hellish time for them, the food still needs a little bit of refinement.", "date": "2013-05-14 20:47:57"}

We each opted for a sushi dinner, which came with either miso soup or a salad. My meal came with a California roll, a spicy tuna roll, and an eel roll (I think.).  They were all good! I will say that a few of my rolls fell apart pretty easily, but not a big deal. They all tasted fresh and were just as good as any other sushi I've had elsewhere.

There's also a good salad bar AND dessert, which featured gulab jamuns -- . fried spongy milky balls soaked in rose scented syrup.  An unlimited supply of those can be deadly.\n\nEven better, they had an idli station.  Idli is like a South Indian pancake made of fermented lentil and rice (gluten-free).  You can then trick out your idli with any of the 8 chutney/relish options available. The sweet spicy ginger one was insane! And the coconut cashew also did the trick.  There is also all-you-can-drink serve-yourself masala chai.  They let you sweeten it yourself.  \n\nAnd the shocker -- all this was just 11 bucks.  Crazy!.  No wonder the place had a good crowd around 1pm.  The buffet is served from 12 to 3 on Sunday.  Just a note -- most of the stuff on the buffet was pretty spicy.  If you can't handle spice you might want to order off the menu.\n\nI believe there is new management there now.  I spoke to one of the new owner/managers and she was extremely helpful and friendly.

I really liked the breadsticks and the Sidekicks Supreme pizza.  \n\n  I was surprised to find street parking just around the corner at lunchtime on Saturday.  (Free is good!)  Anyway, we walked past two other restaurants/bars in the Action Bowl building and saw the sign/stand in front of the entrance.  (It still says Shelby in bold letters over the doorway.)  As we entered, we saw the sign to seat ourselves and our waitress noticed us and greeted us, echoing the sign to sit wherever we liked.  We chose a window seat so that we could see the fountains and people watch.\n\n  Our waitress was over promptly and maintained good service throughout our lunch.  She kept busy doing prep work while not attending us and managed to deal with carryout orders as well.  I noticed another sign that they now have Uber Delivery available.\n\n  While waiting for our food, I noticed they have pictures of sidekicks all around the restaurant. I recognized many of them. There is also a pinball game to help pass time.  A long bar is available for patrons to order one of the bottled beers or local brews (I think there were 8 on tap.)\n\n Our breadsticks came out first.  We ordered 4 sticks which came with two choices of dipping sauces.  (Breadsticks can be ordered in 2, 4, or 6 and there are six varieties of dipping sauces to choose from).  We ordered the marinara and the nacho cheese.  The nacho cheese comes with red peppers diced into the sauce.  Both sauces were tasty and the sticks were flatter than I have had elsewhere, but that was a good thing.  They seemed to have a little more crispness than most I've tried.\n\n  Our pizza arrived and was very good!  This thin crust pie had plenty of mozzarella that stretched when I lifted each slice. The green peppers were cut large, but were cooked thoroughly, so that was a nice surprise.  Plenty of flavor.  The crust itself was crisp around the rim, but just a little soggy in the center which made it hard to pick up at first.  There was just a little grease from the pepperoni, but just enough to lick my fingers, not make a mess.  Overall, I would order this again and since there were 8 slices, I had to get a box for my leftovers.\n\n  I haven't tried their salads or sandwiches yet, but based upon my experience, I would gladly bring friends here to eat and maybe grab a brew.\n\nReview #341\n\np.s.  This is the third restaurant I have been to in this location.  It is quirky here on its own, but seeing the same basic layout with new decor just adds to the oddness of the experience.", "date": "2017-07-08 21:07:30"}

Not only where they not what I was expecting to receive with a lunch meal (ordered at 11am), but they were way overlooked, some burnt, and completely cold.

We visited on a Friday around lunch. It's not a huge place but has a good sized bar area along with a long and high community table as the main seating options.

These days 20 beers is a solid number but not amazing. What is amazing about the 20 beers they had on when we visited was the quality level of the producers represented. A few great local brewers you don't see a lot around town, Draughtsmen and The Brewhouse as well as some fairly rare sightings from outside the area like Bottle Logic , El Segundo and 21st Amendment. Sour beer lovers take note, spots 11-13 on the board are reserved for sour beers.. Overall this is a great place. Staff are great, vibe is really good, it can get packed but on a not too crowded day it's a place you just never want to leave.

Everything is order at the counter(s) - salad bar, sandwich & soup bar, prepared foods bar and then an open air market throughout.\nThe prices: it's not cheap ($10+ for brunch entrees, mimosa carafe $22)\nThe service: Not fair to comment, since it was the soft opening...it was exactly where it should've been for a soft opening.\nThe food: errrrr, I had the B.E.L.T. and my counterpart had the chicken and waffle biscuit. I felt like I wanted more to mine (more egg? more arugula? more balance?) the best part was the toasted sourdough. The biscuit...It's huge - as in, big gulp huge. I regret saying, it was a bit dry and seemed to be more on display and less tasty, but I digress, how do you eat something that big anyways.\n\nGrits were delish, but lacked any jalape\u00f1o spice and the potatoes were actually very good, crispy and all.\nAnother friend had flattering things to say about the breakfast burrito as well. It was all....good.\n\nAlso, to be clear, this was a soft opening, so I think there are always things to iron out, however, this is not their first rodeo. I don't think I would personally return (I'm cheap), however, the space itself is worth a look and if you need a brunch place in this area for parents or out-of-towners it is dressed to impress, I have no doubt they'll do well. \nI would imagine the night time wine bar is pretty nice as well - okay, I'd probably give another try for a special brunch or drink if I ever venture into Midtown.", "date": "2017-06-21 16:26:40"}

Bury me with it. New Orleans is trying to get up in the pizza game and it's about time; we are way behind. Yes we have Pizza D and yes there's Mid City Pizza, Slice and let's not forget Theo's. However where each of those places excel in ingredients and tastiness, it's hard to find an excellent pie that is relative in price to the cost of what it takes to make each one. Blaze has that component down packed and for that, they're getting my #1 best pizza spot in Nola...for now. \n\nYou can get a nice sized pie for under $10 with however many toppings you want in any combination. It's like the Subway of pizza but I dare not put Blaze's quality on Subway's level. Nestled in a newer, edgier sector of downtown it's got that modern touch to its interior. You can choose from their specialty pizzas or build your own. Since it was my first time I went with a specialty as I didn't want the pressure of building something I'd regret.\n\nI went with the Meat Eater, pause. Came out super quick, the only setback I had about it was when asked if I wanted a sauce as a topping, I went with the bbq which it was good, however I don't think I would have wanted it swirled over my whole pie. I should've asked if I could get some on the side. Wasn't expecting to commit my entire pizza to that, but hey, ya live n ya learn. \n\nSuper friendly and attentive staff, I also appreciated that the guy running the place went around and asked people if they were happy with their orders. A little bit goes a long way in hospitality with me. I'd definitely drop in here if I were you needing a downtown fix for a good pizza.", "date": "2016-07-14 20:25:51"}

We sat on the patio and though it was busy, our wait time wasn't bad, and our waitress made sure to stop by a few times to check in with us.\n\nWe started with the fried green tomatoes with a horseradish cream sauce. These were very well prepared; piping hot with a crunchy batter. Neither greasy nor burnt. I had the shrimp and grits and it was very good. Just a touch of heat, very smooth, and at least eight medium-sized shrimp. The gravy was a bit oily/greasy but that is to be expected, based on the dish. I would have preferred a little more grits to soak up the sauce, but in all it was nice.\n\nFor desert we shared the flash-fried wonton-wrapped chocolate chip cookie dough. Very rich and heavy! I am not a big fan of sweets or deserts, but my spoon kept slipping back into the dish. They served it with ice cream which provided another texture and cooled the wonton a bit. If you are a fan of any one ingredient listed in this desert, you really ought to try it.\n\nI can't give you a specific reason for less than five stars; there is no one reason. It is a nice, slightly trendy, restaurant that caters to the Vanderbilt students. Now I am scratching my head so there is this. The road is very heavily traveled and it often takes 10 minutes or more to move the few blocks before and after Jackson's.

I had to call corporate multiple times on a single employee think the name is Jasmine.  This young person has BY FAR THE WORST ATTITUDE EVER!!!!! Quick snapshot I am a public servant went through the drive thru to pick up my order which is NEVER an issue with any other employee I while in uniform asked can you apply emergency service employee discount? She said \"WHAT\" I again repeated myself same question she immediately turned her back and threw my bag of food on the counter and said I can't believe he wants a discount.  That made me be not so kind in response...my wife spoke to the manager and then called the corporate office they were going to look into it.  Fast forward about a month later went inside same location hadn't went there for a long time because of the little jerk employee she strikes me as the type that would spit in your food... anyway went in there with regular clothes on not sure if she recognized me from the month ago anyway she said \"is there a reason you are looking at me?\"  Again my response was not to kind as I wasn't staring or giving her any reason to say anything to me.. She just in true HOODRAT format I guess called herself challenging me! The manager while seemingly a nice guy has ZERO control over this little young employee to the degree my assessment was I have to reach a higher level to speak on this.  I know that CHICK FIL A everywhere and I have lived in many places has an extensive hiring process to include keeping Bokeefa and dem out dat spot.... through multiple interviews, ensuring no visible tattoos, no mixed hair color, assume a personality check.. Although the aforementioned person doesn't have the hair or tattoo issues the personality is indeed dysfunctional!! SO obviously they missed one!  Had to call Corporate again on the second incident they said they were sending someone to this location based upon second complaint on the same person! Again manager was a nice guy but lacked the control of the establishment! CHICK FIL A is not the cheap place to eat as such (fast food) u just expect a little better in the service department! Do better or change the staff!!! Other than that further up Roosevelt Boulevard is 100% always on point ZERO issues!!!!

Crazy. \n\nI asked for a refill on my water and the bartender grabbed a pitcher, slammed it down in front of me and then said \"you can have it then.\" WHAT!!!  Ok ignored that too, we went outside to the batting cages which were really neat and busy but not overly crowded. \n\nWe got hungry so I grabbed a menu and placed my order at the bar- sort of. I started with my guys food order and she just turned around and said \"ok\" totally cutting me off as she walked away.. I had to yell over the volume of the place wait I'm not done!! Then when the food came a confused looking young girl who ran our food looked at me like I was insane for asking for ketchup and mustard for a hot dog. Which when she brought the mustard it was clogged so bad I couldn't even get it out, gross. \n\nOverall, food was good and at least I had my pitcher of water, lol. I grabbed rounds of beers for the boys a couple times  to get out of the smoking area temporarily and the service was quick and to the point. \n\nWhen it came time to close our tab the bartender was SO sweet and nice, obviously.

But the wait could have been shorter if the staff were more attentive. There were already vacant seats but it took another 5 mins before they call the next guest on the list.

Just a fishy patty of some sort.\n\nFried calamari/scallop/shirmps - They were cooked just right. Could have been perfect if they were not salty.\n\nRock crab special, served with soup and salad - Soup and salad were served first, expecting they were cooking the crab. After 20 mins, we follow up on the crab and it was brought to our table right away... It was big! At least the top shell.. Underneath the deceiving shell was a crab half of the top shell size. The top shell was even clean, meaning it was empty like as if it has been washed and used several times already. Also, we waited 20 mins for a steamed crab to be served COLD.. Not just room temperature but like it came out of the fridge. Thinking we may have placed the order wrong, we asked the server if it was supposed to be cold. She acted surprised and took the crab back and said she will send it back to be reheated. She came back just few minutes after she sent back the crab, im not surprised that its still not warm. What a waste of money. \n\nSilverwares have heavy water stains, looks very unsanitary. Forks were crooked.

I digress.\n\nThe best thing about the restaurant is the decor. I love it. It's interesting enough to blow way past tacky and circle back around to being attractive and fun.\n\nThe second best thing is the hot sauce they have on the table, the first hot sauce I've had on a restaurant table in New Orleans that actually applied a higher ratio of heat than vinegar. I'm a hot sauce nut, and I'll do some dousing in Crystal or Tabasco if it's right for the dish. But those are not spicy hot sauces, and I don't want them anywhere near my Mexican food.\n\nAs for the food, it was hit or miss. The tacos were good, but not outstanding. I had the pork with chicharrones, and the chicharrones actually seemed like bagged pork rinds. It was a good taco concept, and I enjoyed it, but it didn't have the taste and texture of mama's homemade chicharrones (translation for Louisianas - it's the difference between grandmama's cracklin and what you buy off a shelf at the corner store). The sides were mostly good, but one, the charred onions, were fibrous and inedible.\n\nThe worst part about the meal, though, were the taco tortillas. They were blue. And I don't mean blue corn, blue. I mean like bright, blue-green blue. Like Florida Marlins teal. Like, this is not the color of food in the real world blue. Like I don't really want to eat this blue. Not that it stopped me, mind you. But I wish it was just a normal-colored taco.", "date": "2016-02-25 03:40:48"}

Eschewing the Ruth Chris chain experience, I figured that Carmine's Steakhouse would offer a more uniquely \"Saint Louis\" feel. To be forthcoming it really feels like a Hotel Restaurant (as it is) which in and of itself is not a particularly bad thing, it is just the service was a bit stiff and forced for my liking. Also, the interior is quite dated.\n\nThe menu is about as stereotypical as Steak House dining gets and all of the usual suspects in Midwestern dining are well represented. The local favorite \"Toasted Ravioli\" was my first order in and is came to the table at breakneck speed. Basically it is the same as any Ravioli, just twice the size and Breaded and deep fried. Considering the great hype surround the dish i was honestly underwhelmed. It basically tasted like an amalgamation of Ground Beef, grease and Marinara with a bit of crunchy mouth feel mixed in. Ho hum at best but I came for steak, so it was not a deal killer at that point. \n\nAs for the Steak, Carmine's does put out a very solid 21 day aged Bone-In Ribeye when they get the temperature right. On the kitchen's first attempt my Steak came to the table still eating the salad. After returning it to the kitchen (I loathe doing this), a perfectly marbled 20 ounce piece of charred delight came to my table seared to order (medium rare) along with Steak Butter on their second try. Returning meat to a kitchen in a Steakhouse always irks me, but at least they erred to the side of caution.  \n\nAs I side I ordered the Twice Baked Potato which was rather uninspired and boring thanks too being under-seasoned. \n\nIn closing, Carmine's Steakhouse is probably a pass for future visits if and when I get back to Saint Louis as there are several other Chop Houses in the area that deserve a fair shake before a return trip. 2 stars and moving on.", "date": "2014-10-29 13:19:15"}

You must buy a soda or bottled water.  This isn't a big deal for some, but drinking water is one of the ways we try to cut expenses so that we can eat out more often.  (Really?  You can't provide a small plastic cup?)  They also ran a coupon in the Entertainment Book which they will not honor.  Finally, on several occasions I have found small bits of bone in the meat.

Im going to start right off the bat with what I and my boyfriend ordered.  I ordered a cappuccino (I have been ordering them EVERYWHERE lately so I base my experience on everywhere else in fishtown/no libs that offers a cappuccino) and my boyfriend ordered his usual plain iced coffee (he orders it even in the dead of winter so he's tried an iced coffee all over as well).  Ill get to the point, my cappuccino was 'eh'- it tasted burnt and unpure.  I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know a good cup when I taste one and this wasn't it.  My boyfriend said his iced coffee tasted watered down and unremarkable.  He ordered an everything bagel with butter and I just opted for a yogurt because thats what I was in the mood for.  The bagel was also 'eh' and the butter literally tasted like nothing (not sure if that's what theyre going for or not but it was unremarkable as well).  All in all, that's exactly our experience this morning- unremarkable.  I hate leaving reviews like this because I want to give places the benefit of the doubt and maybe we just didn't order a good signature coffee that theyre known for or maybe we should have tried a pastry but I had to go by the rating system and since I went by the rating system, the experience was \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  The prices are better than other coffee shops in the area but that doesnt mean the quality should lack.  I'd rather pay the extra couple of bucks for a really truly good experience.  \nAnd when I talk experience I am not just referring to the food and drink.  The establishment itself was \"meh\"- water stains on the ceiling (signifying a leak of some sort- not something to take lightly) and overall the interior decor was just shotty.  Granted, the floor was clean (always something I look for), the service was polite but not out of their way friendly, the utensils were clean and there werent any bugs floating in my drink, but at 2 stars as Yelp's rating states- my experience was all around 'meh'.

Wow! I am a die hard Woodlands Nashville fan when it comes to Indian food, but Persis has stolen my heart with their Gobi Manchuria and Bhindi Masala. \n\nSmall and unassuming in a strip shopping center off the main drag by Providence, but don't let this fool you. The space is adorable and clean in white and gray decor, and the delicious smell hits you when you open the door. \n\nOur server was so sweet and friendly, and agreed with our decision of Gobi Manchuria for an appetizer. I will now get this every time I come. The spice is perfection. I always err on the side of caution and get mild spice, and it was perfect without being overpowering. \n\nThe Bhindi Masala was a generous portion of tender chunks of okra cooked with tomatoes and onions, and the rice was cooked to perfection. My dining friend ordered the Vegetable Biryani, and I think I probably ate a lot of her food, too! Once again, a huge portion of food and the flavor was on point. \n\nI actually left my credit card here the first time I came in, and ended up ordering take out when I went to pick it up. If you do take out, call ahead. It can take 20-30 minutes. I have nothing bad to say--I'll be driving to Mt Juliet for my Indian cravings from now on. Yummy!", "date": "2015-12-22 00:34:32"}

There were little cheese balls and olives and I don't even know what else. I can't remember because it was so forgettable. \n\nSecond, I got the verde salad and it was eh. It didn't have enough avocado and it was also way too bitter. I was so excited for the pasta I ordered, but was again...sorely disappointed. The servings were small and it was extremely garlicky.

I had a great dinner which lead right into our trip to San Francisco so I'll have to write about it later! In the mean time, just wanted to post up my visit to ROAST Coffeehouse on 104 St!\n\nIt took me a long time to make my way down to ROAST but I finally did it. As much as I love the atmosphere of Transcend (may you return to downtown one day) and Credo, I think I like ROAST the best! Something about the wooden interior, the expansive seating areas and trendy wallpaper makes it a place where I'd want to sit and relax.\n\nJoe and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty bustling from what would have expected. Another plus: their menu is extensive, serving up specialty drinks as well (Credo, please expand, I can't drink straight coffee!). ROAST also serves food and wine after 4pm, which makes me want to return ASAP!\n\nFor that day though, we were happy with our drinks. Joe and his regular latte, decorated with their signature 'R' (to go, because he just had a cup of coffee with breakfast), and a dark chocolate mocha for me. This is the first time I've ever had a mocha where I didn't find was too bitter (aside from anything served at Starbucks, pure cream and sugar). Absolutely loved my drink!\n\nROAST Coffeehouse, thus far, is my favorite out of all coffee hangouts. Runner-up: Wild Earth Bakery. I only wished I discovered these places when I was in school!

I was surprised by how empty the restaurant was, given that it was prime brunch time. The inside of the restaurant is modern looking, but with exposed pipes and a hipster twist. We were seated by the large windows in a booth overlooking the street. With the warm September light streaming in, it was the perfect brunch atmosphere. \n\nI ordered the 24 Brunch, which consisted of two eggs (any style), potato hash, focaccia bread, and bacon. Though the individual components of the meal was typical diner-brunch fare, the quality of the ingredients was high and relatively affordable ($10.00). The focaccia bread, shaped into sticks, was thick and pillowy with nice herb flavoring and a toasted shell. The eggs were cooked medium-hard, like I'd requested, and the potato hash was solid, but not anything special. In hindsight, I wish that I had ordered my eggs sunny side-up like my friend, so that I could dip the focaccia in the egg. Relative to the rest of the meal, there was a lot of focaccia bread. The portion sizes were substantial, but not generous. What surprised me the most about the meal was the bacon. The bacon wasn't cooked in any special way that I was aware of, but it was delicious. Bacon has a leg up in being delicious, given that its bacon, but this bacon was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. My other friend ordered the mixed berry waffle, which he reported as \"fruit on top of a waffle.\" He enjoyed it, but wouldn't necessarily pay $11.00 to eat it again.\n\nOverall, we had a nice time. The service was very attentive while we were there and the atmosphere was relaxed.

Decided to let them get the opening kinks out. Unfortunately, looks like they won't be here in 2016.\n\nThe Good: The Thai Chicken Taco was very good. Great flavor and good value for $3. Don't know why someone hasn't thought of this combo before.  Nice blending of a soft taco with rice, chicken, Thai flavoring and slaw.  My coconut soup was also tasty. Value-both of us ate for just over $20-not bad!\n  \nThe Bad: Yikes-a long list. One of the girls who took orders was very helpful. The other one who waited on us either was sick or may have smoked some herb before work. Totally out of it, didn't know much and didn't want to be there. NOT the person who should be greeting customers. The Pad Thai was a little dry so we asked for and received some extra sauce. Well, it definitely wasn't pad thai sauce. How can an Asian restaurant mess up pad thai?  We ordered Pot stickers and the order included THREE pot stickers.  They were OK, but there was hardly any pork inside-mostly veggies and rice.  The teriyaki chicken taco was also uninspiring.\n\nSorry so negative-we had such high hopes for the Tin Drum.  The Tin Drum has a fun, clean d\u00e9cor and should be a hit. Unfortunately, their recipes overall don't deliver. We were there at 7:30 PM on a Friday and it wasn't crowded. Not empty, but not \"hopping\".  In this neck of Oldsmar there is a lot of competition for your food dollar.  My prediction is the competition will be cruel to the Tin Drum.", "date": "2015-07-18 01:07:43"}

All great seafood stops should be reservation free and first come first serve.  \n\nIf you have to wait for 15 minutes not a big deal, if it's 3 hours it can be a bit discouraging.

I think we got lucky.   \n\nWe started off with some clam strips (served with onion rings, tarter and cocktail sauce) and a cup of clam chowder. We ordered it right when we were seated at the bar and it cam within a couple of minutes. We decided to get the Cioppino and split it. I have never had Cioppino in a bread bowl before but it makes the perfect companion. All of the soup soaks in to the bread. It was a healthy sized serving to split. A bunch of crab, scollops, shrimp and clams. They ask you how spicy you want it, we went with a more mild soup and it was perfect for us, just a little bit of kick.  \n\nThey have a good selection of wine and beer.

We all ordered food, and I was excited for my taste buds because this place boasts some of the best burgers in Nashville, all made with natural local beef. I ordered the Blue Cheese Burger (bacon, blue cheese crumbles, grilled onions) and waffle fries.\n\nFood came out pretty quick, but let me tell you....it was worth it no matter how long we waited for it. It was truly the most amazing burger I have ever had in my life. The blue cheese crumbles were perfectly melted on the burger, it was juicy, the bacon was crisp...it was literally heaven on a bun. I'm not a huge fan of fries but the waffle fries were pretty run of the mill, made amazing by me drenching them in Tabasco sauce and then dipping them in the spinach dip that Chris had ordered, which was TO DIE FOR.\n\nI went the following night, on a Thursday, when they have 2-4-1's starting at 4PM. Other notable specials are Happy Hours Mon-Fri 4PM-7PM ($1 off apps, liquor, wine and beer), $2 domestic drafts on Saturdays, and $2 drafts all day on Sunday. They also have trivia on Tuesday where you can win up to $50.\n\nThey have a brunch menu on the website, which looks AMAZING. Brunch is served Saturday & Sunday 10AM - 3PM and I'm really considering flying in next Friday evening to sample what must be a delicious treat in the AM.\n\nI give Melrose a hearty 4 1/2 stars. One of my favorite bars that I've been to in Nashville. So if you're ever in town, I'd definitely suggest stopping by here, if not for the friendly staff and great atmosphere, then for the burgers.

The first owner did an amazing job and this restaurant was famous in the Korean community - everyone who loved soon dubu knew this place was their go-to. However, owners changed somewhere along the way and the quality of the soondubu went down drastically. The flavors changed, there was less tofu, less seafood in the haemul soon dubu, and the somethin flavor was off.\n\nLast year I gave it another try on a cold day and I was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant was really good again! They put in the right amount of spice (4 out of 5), it was a bit sparse on the seafood again, but plenty of tofu. I went a few more times after that, and the last couple visits I noticed the quality go down again.\n\nI just went again with my [Korean] parents and was so disappointed that I don't think I will be coming here again for awhile. My dad got the clam soon dubu (level 2 spice) and it was ALRIGHT but maybe because it wasn't spicy. My mom ordered the doenjang soon dubu and it was just salty. There was no flavor and no substance I thought I was tasting super concentrated ocean water with soft tofu. My mom couldn't take more than 2 spoons because of how ridiculously salty the was. I ordered the haemul soondubu as usual (level 4 spice), and the seafood was sparse masked by a ton of tofu while the flavor was also a little off. Also, due to kitchen renovations the rice was not served in dolsot (stone pots) which was a huge part of my soon dubu experience.\n\nTo top off the decrease in quality of the food, we asked [multiple times] for plastic containers to bring home the leftovers but was told that those containers were only for take out customers. Instead, we were given these small foam containers that were could easily get crushed. We asked for one more plastic bag just to pack our leftovers separately but they insisted on only one bag per customer even though there were 3 people with 3 separate orders. Clearly the economy is hitting them hard and the quality of food and customer service is sinking with it.", "date": "2014-01-21 04:53:09"}

The table is centered with extra olive oil and chili oil, which you can add to enhance or spice up your meal.  \n\nAlways remember with better ingredients come elevated prices.  Expect to pay a little more for these fresher, healthier dishes. \n\nKatie's also delivers excellent service that is knowledgeable, quick and accurate.  We were not disappointed in the service.  They seated us quickly and served us efficiently. \n\nWhat stops this place from being a five? The prices did effect my rating.  While seafood and fresh ingredients are frequently listed on the menu, I have experience fresh, larger (in portion size ) meals, that were lower in price. My own personal bias, also effected the rating. Italian is not my favorite, so it is based primarily on my personal taste.  If this review were over Italian food, it would be a five.  \n \nSo next time you want to take an afternoon or evening and step out of the traditional St. Louis Italian, try Katie's Pizza.

The menus that were brought were stained and torn. The server was awkward and lingered uncomfortably every time he came to the table.\n\nMy friend ordered something with tuna, which the server was unsure if they still had. He returned to tell us that they were probably getting rid of all of their tuna dishes and that she would need to order something else (if the tears and stains weren't enough reason to reprint their menus, surely that would be?!) The spinach dip I ordered had been clearly microwaved... sort of microwave-burnt on the edges and cool in the middle.\n\nThe bartender was eating behind the bar (how they have a good health score is beyond me!). I got up to use the restroom at one point and passed the server and the cook who were on opposite sides of where food is picked up. They were both munching on something. I got back to my table and found that the server had brought me extra chips... and I can only assume given the timing and the fact that only one other table was in there, that what they had been munching on were my chips.

This was a recommendation from a local couple we met the night before at the carousel bar in the hotel Monteleone (another must visit).  Glad we listened.  We tried the Gumbo Ya Ya and YA it was YUM.  Then the beer battered, coconut shrimp... Delish!  Then for my sister it was a burger since she's not really a seafood fan. Huge portion and a juicy mouthwatering meat patty on a brioche bun. Yum and Done! Lastly, my Shrimp angel hair pasta was very good. A little too safe for me and I will branch further next trip. Some Cajun seasoning on the shrimp and rich herb and buttered angel hair cooked to perfection.  It was very good but if you want to get the full experience opt for something more authentic. I will and will do it next time I visit by coming back to Mr. B's Bistro... \n OH and did I say how wonderful the wait staff was. Three amazing gents took great care of us.

Maybe it is what was termed CRS when I was in the military...can't remember shit.

This was a really good thing as the heat added considerably to the experience.  It was not a burning heat; rather, just enough to make you notice without being painful or detracting from the flavors of the food.\n\nThere were layers of flavor in everything we tried.  If you take a bite and then think about what you're tasting you can discern some interesting complexities.  \n\nTandoori chicken (not sure why that name resonates but others do not) was perfectly cooked.  Juicy, tender and flavorful with a hint of smokiness.  Simply delicious and the best version of this dish I've every tried.   \n\nTheir sauces are very flavorful and everything was really fresh tasting.  They had a great variety of dishes available for us to try.  Some were vegetarian, others were lamb and chicken.  Some were in sauces, others were deep fried.

At the 12South location, there are community style tables and even the booths/tables are extremely closed together and packed close---so get ready for your neighbors to hear your entire conversation.", "date": "2018-09-25 23:42:21"}

It is a bit off the beaten track in a semi-residential area. We went with friends on a Tuesday night and were a little concerned that the place was empty, but we decided to give it a chance, and were very happy we did.  We split a couple of salads (nuts and berries salad and grilled pears salad) and were very happy with those.  There was plenty to share and it was tasty.  Two of us got a red snapper special (which, tho they didn't quote the price, turned out to be very much in line with the standard menu prices).  It was absolutely delicious, prepared perfectly, and came with a very flavorful risotto and some thin asparagus.  It was described as having a pear sauce which might be true but a pear flavor did not particularly stand out, tho it was indeed very light and flavorful. One of our friends got the gorgonzola chicken which was also quite delicious, with a slight, very pleasant smoky flavor atop the strong gorgonzola flavor. It also had some asparagus, My wife got the Osso Bucco (veal shank) which was very savory and tender.  Everybody was pleasantly surprised at the thorough enjoyment of the meal.  We topped it off by splitting an order of cannolis for dessert.  The atmosphere is casual and informal, but pleasant, very fitting of its name \"trattoria\",  The chef came out to check in with us briefly a couple of times and was warm and friendly without being overbearing.  The service was also very accommodating and attentive, though as the only customers, we would expect that.  The entrees all ran fairly expensive in the $25-$30 range but we were very pleased and satisfied with the meal.  As a BYOB we certainly saved money on drinks, and I don't recall being charged any corkage fee.  Overall with tax and tip the meal came to about $44 each. I would highly recommend this place and will be back.", "date": "2016-10-05 16:34:58"}

The location has just been open a week, so perhaps my experience was related to that, or perhaps simply to the stylist I had--but it was acute enough that I will not go back.\n\nThis was my first experience with a Sports Clips. While I knew going in that part of the business model was the \"sports/TV\" theme, they also advertise themselves as \"specialists\" in men's hair. I did not feel like my treatment was elevated in any way unique to their location.\n\nI received their second-tier haircut, \"the MVP,\" which advertises a precision haircut, shampoo, scalp massage, hot facial towel, and a neck/shoulder massage. If all of these were good--it might be a good deal.\n\nMy haircut was NOT a precision haircut. It was done by someone recently out of school. You know when someone is taking their time because they being thorough vs. when someone is going slow because they aren't experienced enough to go more quickly...the second was my stylist. She did not cut confidently. I have a beard, and my stylist asked me a sideburn-related question most stylists ask, \"Would you like me to do anything different with your sideburns?\" I responded, \"No, go ahead and blend them into the beard.\" The next thing I see, she uses the trimmer to chop off my sideburns and then cut a 3/4\" gap between them and the beard. When I looked incredulously at the sides and asked her why she did that she said, \"It was miscommunication on both our parts.\" That is not what you tell the customer. My other complaint with the stylist was that her method of speaking through every step of \"the MVP treatment\" felt very patronizing, as if I was going to get a haircut for the first time.\n\nRegarding the rest of the MVP treatment--it is not that great. The scalp massage had very little pressure to it...perhaps it was my inexperienced stylist. The \"massage chair\" in the back just buzzed...barely vibrated. I asked the stylist to turn it off. Massage chairs in the mall are better. Finally, the neck/shoulder massage, done by a handheld machine, was again lackluster. It is not a massager. It vibrates a bit, but isn't nearly as relaxing as your Homedics or Brookstone hand massager at home. I asked the stylist to press harder on the machine, but it didn't make a difference. Then I just asked her to turn it off. \n\nIf what you care most about is the sports TV during your haircut, this is the place to go. Otherwise--if you're intrigued by the massages, they aren't great. And the haircut is no better than any entry-level salon.", "date": "2014-07-16 21:23:15"}

The restaurants inside are great and every time we have gone, there is live entertainment. And the thing that has me hooked is that they have a Christie cookie inside the hotel. Forget the restaurants and club, I love christie cookies. Anyone who is from Nashville has probably tried them but I was so happy that we could share this with the people who visit our city. I now see why people love this hotel so much.", "date": "2013-01-03 19:22:59"}

My dish was delightful; pasta tossed in olive oil with pine nuts, sun dried tomato with fresh garlic and basil. I was in pasta paradise. It was simple, refreshing, and extremely good. My friends loved their dishes as well and we were all members of the clean plate club. \n\n        When our waitress came back to ask if there would be dessert we couldn't turn it down--it was my friends birthday after all. Once she knew this, she created a \"sample platter\" especially for us, on the house. She brought us in house made tiramisu, a chocolate chip filled cannoli, and a dish of ice cream that was pretty amazing--everyone's favorite (possibly chocolate chip with some sort of sweet fig possibly) And all of their ice cream is from Serendipity's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/serendipity-homemade-ice-cream-st-louis) so I must say kudos for also promoting a fellow local business. \n\nMamma Mia! This was an extremely satisfying meal and first visit to this charming cafe.", "date": "2012-06-28 13:28:11"}

So, one day when jonesing for sugar a fellow sugar addict and I headed off to the Bulk Barn.\n\nI purchased a few of my favorite snacks from the bins: licorice laces, gummy bears and sour cream puffs to name a few. My friend had an equally luscious load. I probably dropped about $40 and she $50. We couldn't  wait to get to the car to twist open a few bags and start the sugar rush and when we finally got the bags open wow.. what a disappointment!  My licorice laces were like eating the leather laces on my boots. I might have pulled off a crown trying to dislodge a gummy bear from my tooth and my girlfriend was dry heaving beside me. Need I say more.\n\nThoroughly disappointing. The most stale and vile junk food I have ever had the displeasure of eating. The bulk goods must have been in those bins for who knows how long ??? That coupled with the occassional grubby hands dipping into the bins to steal samples when no one was looking; disgusting. In fact it was so bad we threw it all in the garbage.\n\nI learned a costly but valuable lesson that day, and no,  it wasn't to stop eating so much junk food..lol, rather  \"To ensure freshness always buy your candy individually packaged\". \n\nBulk Barn gets a 5 popcorns down!", "date": "2012-11-07 23:49:26"}

The restaurant serves contemporary Creole cuisine in a warm relaxed atmosphere. Signature dishes include Gumbo Ya Ya, Barbequed Shrimp, and Bread Pudding with Irish Whiskey Sauce (see menu). The service is amazing- the waiters always happy and welcoming. If you happen to have the Barbeque shrimp (which is really a must if you go to this restaurant) they even go so far as to put on your bib for you (needed to peel the shrimp), bring you hot towels and lemon and continuous servings of fresh out of the oven french bread, which ofcourse you proceed to dip in the bbq shrimp sauce (probably the best part of the meal). The gumbo ya ya is also a must- definitely one of the best I have had since my time in New Orleans...and I have had ALOT of Gumbo. Finishing off with a plate of desert you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu: my favorites- the profiteroles (a french dessert consisting of light fluffy dough filled with vanilla ice-cream and topped with dark chocolate sauce (TO DIE FOR), if you want something more New Orleans in flavor then try the home made breadpudding.

Like another reviewer, I noticed that the staff was sitting chatting with friends when I walked in, but she stood right up to assist me.  She offered her recommendation for an Earl Grey with Caramel Latte.  It was a great choice.  Good flavor... and something I never would've considered on my own.\n\nMy one (maybe two) issues with Red Hook is that the place feels a bit like visiting a college kid's shared house.  The mismatched furniture is cute, but worn and dirty.  There was dust and dirt everywhere.  And, probably due to the heat outside and frequent door openings, lots of bugs.

There is so much that I need to say, good and critical. \n\nFirst the food: \nAs of this review, this is my second visit within two days. The first time it went well. I stayed in and ate at the restaurant. I ordered a brisket quesadilla and a side of rice and beans. The food was good, not great but good. The brisket had good flavor.. The food tastes fresh. \n\nI was curious enough to try other items. So I went back the next day with my wife. We ordered takeout. She ordered a chicken quesadilla w/ side of rice and beans. I ordered a chicken burrito with side of rice and beans. This is where it went downhill for us. We live like less than 10 minutes away maybe 5-7 minutes. The rice and beans were pretty much cold, almost felt like it was never even heated up. Not the worst thing, I could just heat it up. The quesadilla ended up just being shredded chicken breast with cheese. It didn't have anything to add flavor. The burrito was pretty much the same way, only that it had rice and beans inside the burrito with chicken. It didn't have any flavor at all. \n\nI would have liked at least the common ingredients like green peppers and onions or tomatoes to add some juice and flavor or some seasoning or spices. It was just too bland.  \n\nThe place: \n\nThe people there are very nice and friendly!!! \n\nIt is a brand new restaurant. They have been there only a few months. I am a big supporter of a new small business and I want them to do well and succeed, which is why I went back to try other items and get a scope of their offerings.  \n\nThey are severely understaffed. The first time I went, there was only one person running the whole place. The guy was a really nice person. We spoke for a little while. He helped to build the place along with the owner. The restaurant decor and appearance is still a work in progress. \n\nThe second time I went, there was a different guy working all by himself. He was very friendly and nice too. \nI was very curious about the cow head meat, so he offered me a sample. The sample was very delicious. It's very fatty, but I think that is part of the experience with that type of meat. \n\nSummary: \n\nI am trying to be very gentle with my review and not trying to hurt them. I want to share the truth about this place because I want the owner to see this and make improvements.\nMy feelings towards this restaurant would be much different had this restaurant been much older than year. \n::::: It's a new place and I strongly feel that it has much potential to improve the quality of food and flavor ::::::: It also needs to increase its employee staff. They need to take a few days and finish the restaurant appearance. \n\nI believe the food quality can also be improved if they have equal training for everyone that cooks and prepares the food. I don't know if the food was just not properly prepared on the second visit or if that is the recipe. \n\n::::Message to the owner and the chef::::: You need to improve the food flavor. That's it. Nothing else. The food tastes like it's fresh, so that is a good thing. \n\nI think anyone looking for some tacos or Mexican food should give this place a chance. Just stay away from the chicken for now if you want something with flavor and you will be okay. The prices are reasonable. The food is simple with no frills. \n\nThey offer: steak, chicken, chorizo, brisket, cow head meat. Also they have eggs with chorizo. On the weekends they offered a meat special. \n\nI will give them another try with the other items. I will try and find out more about the food.", "date": "2017-06-29 14:54:48"}

Our main waiter took our order and then never once did he come back to the table, despite the fact that after 45 minutes we still had no food and needed drink refills. He was checking on other tables around us, but he wouldn't even look at us. The second waiter (Rhett or Brett?) was trying his best, he brought us a second round of drinks and finally brought our food. My husband and I split a burger, each of our kids had pasta, and our granddaughter had fried fish. Our $18 burger and fries were stone cold, completely inedible (this should have been that big, delicious burger you can only get at a bistro). The two pasta dishes were both terrible - the Shrimp & Angel hair Pasta was bland and tasteless, and the Pasta Jambalaya was just gross, it tasted awful. My granddaughter's fried speckled trout was actually delicious. We sent the burger back and waited, and waited, and waited some more. Keep in mind, our main waiter could see all of this unfolding the entire time and still never approached us. Finally we asked to speak to the manager, he didn't seem too concerned and he never apologized, just said he would \"go find our burger.\" After another 15 min or so, we got up to leave and the manager finally showed up with our burger. By this point we didn't even care. Finally, the manager became apologetic and offered to comp our meal, he boxed up our burger to go. After two hours of waiting in a beautiful restaurant, my husband and I ended up hurriedly eating our burger in an Uber on the way to City Park. We will NEVER go back, nor recommend it to anyone. We live just a couple of hours from NOLA and visit frequently; in a city with so many fabulous places to eat, why would we ever give our business to a restaurant that treated us so poorly?", "date": "2017-12-18 19:04:53"}

The Ceviche was delicious, the steak was seasoned perfectly and the Paella was one of the best I've ever had.\n\nThe atmosphere was quiet and more quaint, so probably not the best place to take a large group, but I was in a small group of 4, so it worked well.

This is why you just ask for ID, people!\n- I paid more money for this airport shuttle than I did in Vegas, and it doesn't even take you downtown!

We called to make a Sunday reservation, at 7:30, and were on our way.\n\nUpon arrival, we found the bar area about half full, and the majority of the restaurant empty. So far so good. We then approached the host/hostess stand and promptly waited for 5 minutes, trying to catch the attention of any of the server, all whom purposefully avoided eye contact. Peering at the reservation sheet, i noticed our reservation for 2 was the only one within two hours of any others. Now, 5 minutes standing at a restaurant is a pretty long time, especially in the middle, at the host stand. Finally, a tall man (who we later were told was the owner) bustled up and said verbatim; \"Here's whats gonna happen. You two are gonna sit on this couch over here and we will be with you in five minutes.\" No offer of a drink at the bar, no pleasantries.\nWe sat on the couch for over 15 minutes, feeling like we were children in timeout, being punished. Finally, a waiter approached us and told us to go ahead and sit anywhere we liked. it was very near 8pm at this point. upon sitting at the table for a good 10 minutes, the waiter approached, and we ordered a bottle of wine, waters, and also asked a question about the Mahi Mahi, which we were very excited about. He told us he would have to get back to us, and there we sat for about 15 more minutes.\n\nAs we were getting pretty upset, we saw the server ambling up with our bottle of wine, so our frustrations were temporarily relieved. We asked about the mahi again, and he again told us he had to check. 5 minutes later, he came back and answered our question. Good, as we were pretty hungry at this point in time. We ordered, and sat sipping our wine, watching the owner roam around to literally every table but ours. A good 20 minutes later, the waiter came and told us that they were unfortunately out of Mahi Mahi. This was at 8:45. Still no water. We decided that eating wasn't worth it anymore, and asked why a table of 5 that had just arrived was greeted and seated right away. We were told they had a reservation. When we replied that we also had had one, and we waited a good 25-30 minutes, he actually mumbled something unintelligible while backing away. Still no apology from the owner, or any of the servers. Our waiter came back, and asked if we wanted anything else. We replied that we wanted the check, and finally we were told that the night was crazy and they usually were like a \"well-oiled machine.\" After sitting at the 1/3 full restaurant for over an hour and a half, I highly doubted this claim.\n\nAt this point in time, we were so anxious to leave that we actually recorked our half full bottle of wine, paid the bill, and left. This was by far and away the most horrible restaurant experience I have ever had.\nI would rather eat at a Shoney's than Momos. Please do not give them business. Avoid this place at all costs unless you are in the mood for a night of slow, painful, regret.", "date": "2010-10-11 18:10:04"}

Unfortunately, I don't think our server wanted us to like Mr. B's. \n\nWe wanted to have some post brunch drinks somewhere closer to our hotel.

We didn't want to inconvenience them, but it was 3pm and there was no evident mealtime rush. She assured us it was fine.\n\nClearly, NOT fine. It takes a lot to make me feel guilty for drinking (sorry for partying), but I immediately felt the disapproval from our server. When we had to tell him that we were just drinking (couldn't the hostess have told him that?), there was some major attitude. When he brought us our first round of drinks, he asked if this would be the only round. It just seemed rush, weird, and full of 'tude. I imagine they aren't hurting for business since they have a prime location for hungry tourists that don't feel like looking any further, but that's also probably the same reason they can get away with being a little rude. \n\nIf it wasn't for the supreme politeness and friendliness from other New Orleans restaurants, then maybe my standards wouldn't be so high, but Mr. B's fell short of the outstanding customer service we experienced at virtually every other establishment, yes, even the to-go daiquiri shops.", "date": "2012-07-18 21:15:08"}

We over 3000 people attending check in was hectic but the hotel had several people handling the check in and it went about was well as one could expect.\n\nThe rooms. spacious and comfortable. Our room overlooked the atrium and had a small balcony with a small table and 2 chairs. I would definitely recommend a room on the atrium side. Nice big screen tv, fridge, and microwave. Free internet which I am using as I write this. A little slow for a small fee you can get faster internet.\n\nFood. Very good, especially when we had lunch buffets.

It also came with side of onion rings and cole slaw... \n\nThe combo actually isn't big... it's about 2 pieces of each... but I think the price is reasonable... around $13-14... \n\nFor us it was a good snack before dinner...

The gluten free person was very happy with his vegetable lasagna layered with risotto instead of pasta and shrimp on top.  Shrimp Fra Diablo kept two more lifting their forks with pleasure and lastly the Rigatoni Alio Olio with home made pasta substituted for the riggies was wonderful.  Some came home with us from the generous portions,  The deserts were delish (canolis and blueberry crumble, home made and warm) and again generous portions.

Very tasty with two dipping sauces.  My friend had the octopus in olive oil.  It was sliced thin, very tender and roasted just right.  Too often octopus is overcooked or cut too thick so it's like chewing rubber.  This was perfect!\n\nThe highlight was the Ceviche Mixto. What I liked about it was that it wasn't swimming in a bath of lemon/lime juices but was arranged artistically on the plate covered with slivers of red onions.  One nice touch that I've never seen before is the use of corn....hominy and roasted corn kernals.  The counterpoint of the soft, almost grape-like hominy, with the crunchy but not hard, roasted corn kernals was wonderfully tasty and interesting.   The fish, squid, and octopus were flavorful, spiced just right, and firm so you know it was fresh.\n\nI didn't think it could get any better until the waitress mentioned the mango cheesecake.

However, seeing as that's not going to help anyone, I'm going for it.\n\nFor the most part, Jackson's works the Nashville grungy-hipster-organic vibe well. I like to imagine the designer of the space saying, \"Hey let's suspend a fireplace in the middle of the restaurant! And might as well bring in the corrugated steel, expose the wood beams, and turn off the lights too. Don't forget the garage door style cabana!\" By the end of the meal, this haphazard schematic made me long to be outside in the afternoon sun, but if the dark, loud, and crowded feel appeals to you, then this is the place to be.\n\nMy party and I were seated promptly, given the bustling Sunday afternoon crowd. Our waitress was friendly and quick. Our food, much less so. It was a good thing that my companions and I had a lot to talk about, because it took a noticeably long time for our food to come out. They even apologized twice and told us the food would be out soon. Ten minutes after that, our meal arrives from exactly three feet away from our table.\n\nI think the best way to describe this meal is in bite-sized thoughts. So, I ordered the Ahi Wasabi Caesar Salad and:\n Bite One: Oh, I miss sesame and boy, do I love the sesame crust.\n Bite Two: The salad looks unattractive. But I'll eat it.\n Bite Three: The salad is all right, but I think it's the dressing I like. I miss wasabi too. \n Bite Four: I thought I ordered my tuna medium rare, but it's definitely medium-well. Chewy, not smooth. \n Bite Five: I'll stick with the sesame crust.\n Bites Six through Eighty-Two: Repeat\n Bite Eighty-Three: Too much wasabi, too little lettuce. Too much over-done tuna, too little crust. I'm done.\n\nIt was all right, not too impressive, but then again I'm not easily impressed by food in Nashville anyway. The price range at Jackson's is pretty average too, especially in the Hillsboro area. The salad I had felt a tad bit more expensive ($11). A couple of my friends also had tuna, but in a sandwich, and that was at least $3 less, including fries. \n\nOverall, I'd say Jackson's is average to good.

First problem was the concierge.  Elizabeth acted like she was high or extremely drunk. She was slurring her words and had a glazed look in her eyes. We wanted suggestions on what we could do on Monday before our flight took off in the evening. The best suggestion she had was the mall. We have the best malls in LA. I went online and checked out what things we could do. There were loads of tourist attractions. The concierge was totally useless.\n\nThe second issue we had was with the housekeeping staff.  We stayed here for 5 nights. I used to work in hotels and I know that the sheets need to be changed after the third night. They didn't do that here. I called down and requested the sheets be changed. When we got back to the room the sheets were not changed.

Your food has once again blown my mind (for the third time).  This time was also the best!\n\nSince reading about the mezze dinner promo, I searched and waited for the (few) interested friends to become available to join me on this greek feast.  Sofia only offers the mezze dinner during the summer and a mezze dinner consists of small plates, similar to spanish tapas.\n\nDish 1: Assorted dips served with pita wedges and dolmades.  The dips were tzatziki, a feta cheese/tomato mixture, hummus, a spicy garlic/eggplant dip, and veggie dip.\nThoughts: Ahhhh so good.  My favorite was the feta mixture.  It tasted fantastic!\n\nDish 2: Grilled octopus & feta stuffed calamari.\nThoughts: Wow, I had feta stuffed calamari at Estia and Sofia's just blows theirs away.  Both the octopus and calamari were flavorful and cooked to perfection.\n\nDish 3: Beets with skordalia.\nThoughts:  I've never had beets before, and I will say that my first experience was good.  They were served cold and with a vinagrette of some sort drizzled over.  The skordalia is a \"mashed potato\" type of dish.  In fact, I just may like it better than mashed potatoes.  The amount of garlic in the skordalia was delish!  Both of these together are definitely ingredients to a flavor explosion in one's mouth.\n\nDish 4: Horiatiki salad.\nThoughts:  This is a REAL greek salad.  I'm used to the greek salad with lettuce, feta, olives, anchovies, etc...but this was good...very good.\n\nDish 5: Fried eggplant & zucchini w/ a side of tzatziki.\nThoughts: This kinda reminded me of japanese tempura, except you're dipping into tzatziki.  The veggies had a very light coat of batter and they tasted great dipped into that tzatziki.\n\nDish 6: Scallops & shrimp\nThoughts: I would have loved to have second of this.  The scallops and shrimp were seared and had a delicious crisp, sweet, outside and a juicy, flavorful inside.  Each bite was magnificent....luckily I got to have half of person C's scallop since he didn't eat em.\n\nDish 7: Halloumi cheese wrapped in green peppers and topped with pine nuts\nThoughts: Never had halloumi until this night.  It was grilled and had a lovely flavor.  The combination of the pine nuts, peppers, and cheese was great!\n\nDish 8: Greek bruschetta\nThoughts: This was a pretty interesting take on bruschetta.  A whole slew of veggies and spices served on pita wedges.  They also had that spicy garlic eggplant sauce on it too!  Very good.\n\nDish 9: Lahanodolmades over rice\nThoughts:  Lahanodolmades reminded me of Polish halupkis/galupkis.  They're ground beef stuffed cabbage leaves and tasted great.  A very warm feeling took over me as I ate this.  The kind of feeling you get from eating home cooked chicken noodle soup.  It made me happy.\n\nDish 10: Spanakopita & lamb wrapped in filo\nThoughts: I love spanakopita.  It's flaky filo crust surrounding a tasty, feta infused, spinach center!  Mmm.  The lamb wrapped in filo...I don't remember the name of this, but I wish I knew it.  I believe Sofia served mini versions of this at the Taste of South Jersey food festival and I fell in love with them there.  I need to  find out the name of these so I can order them next time.  Whatever the name, these are also fantastic!\n\nDish 11: Vegetable Stew\nThoughts:  Reminded me of ratatouille..tomato base with many other vegetables.  Very delicious.\n\nDish 12: Pork & Chicken Souvlaki and Biftekia\nThoughts: Both souvlakis were great.  Very tender, juicy cubes of meat, wonderfully accented by the tzatziki.  The biftekia was flavorful, a greek \"meatball\" or \"burger\".  I'm definitely going to have to order these again.\n\nDish 13, 14, 15: Galaktoboureko, Kataifi, Karidopita (not included in the mezze)\nThoughts:  Sofia's desserts are delicious.  The previous desserts I've had (baklava, chocolate ganache over kataifi) were both fantastic as were these.  The galaktoboureko was a tasty custard wrapped in a sweet, crisp filo.  The kataifi was great as it was like a shredded baklava.  The karidopita was a thick, perfectly sweet flavored cake.\n\nOn top of all that, for my third time here, we actually had a Greek waitress this time.  Christina was a very sweet and friendly waitress.  She explained what everything was and even had a chat with us every once in a while when stopping at our table.  Sofia even walked around the dining room for a bit once things calmed down to ask how everyone was doing.\n\n Also, there aren't many Greek restaurants around here (that I know of).  There's Estia in Philly which is good, but is expensive and doesn't quite compare to what Sofia makes here.  I've also been to a couple Greek festivals and Sofia's food seems to blow the food I've had there out of the water.\n\nThis is (hands down) my favorite restaurant here in South Jersey. \n\nDo yourself a favor & check this place out!\n\nNow if I can only manage to gather people up for another mezze dinner...\n\nPS: you may get hungry looking at my photos", "date": "2009-08-11 00:55:53"}

However the menu was limited for vegetarians though the restaurant really tried to accommodate. I had the kale risotto which was very filling. My date (who is also vegetarian) had a tofu steak. Th tofu steak was very well done, of good consistency, and had barbecue sauce. I wasn't a fan of the barbecue sauce because it think it could be better nightlights with an Asian or Mexican style Barbeque sauce. We also had the torched broccoli and crudit\u00e9s platter and rolls with chive butter for appetizers. All these were good though I expected the crudit\u00e9s to be pickled and they we're not.

(coming from SF - this was real good price)\nbone marrow  - $8!!!!! O-M-G (if my co-worker and I were not planning to visit another place for dessert, I think we would have order 2 more of these).\ntrotter cake - I enjoyed this a lot - it was not only a great snack/small dish to go with beer or drinks, it would be a perfect item to go with a big of rice (yes, I totally imagined about mixing the trotter cake with rice, maybe through in a fried egg as well - when I was having it). this labor intensive/time consuming trotter cake is heavenly. \nbacon flight - WOW - this really lives up to the expectation!!  Lamb bacon and goose bacon and Jowl bacon!! and I love the chocolate ganche that comes with it - perfect compliment.

Don't get me wrong, I still continue to go here despite the \"meh\" food, but the attractiveness of Mumbai Bistro lies nearly entirely in the location and the price (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1).\n\nI am definitely glad that there is place in walking distance from both Jefferson and Pennsylvania hospital that serves ready-made Indian food I can grab on my lunch break. The standard hospital cafeteria fare can grow old quickly, and I often fantasize about a delicious curry when I contemplate grabbing something predictable from the hospital cafe. \n\nAnd I suppose it's a smart business strategy to serve Indian food that is palatable to pickier eaters or people who don't normally enjoy spicy cuisine, but for someone like me who loves Indian food for its vibrant and complex flavors, the food served here is a bland facsimile of familiar favorites. The malai kofta and the mixed vegetable curry are probably the best meatless dishes served here, but even those lack the expected richness and texture. The Gobi Malasa tends to be overcooked and mushy and the paneer masala is downright watery. The naan is somewhat soggy and seems like it has been microwaved.\n\nI don't like giving bad reviews, and I want this place to remain in business, but I think there are some very easy fixes they could do to improve the food here, namely not watering down dishes and not using a microwave to heat up naan. I think it is great that they do not use butter or ghee, but I've also made vegan Indian food in my own home that was more flavorful than this, so I don't find the health claims to be a valid excuse for blandness. I think the concept of a cheap vegan & celiac-friendly buffet that is 5$ a pound is a fantastic idea, but I don't think that it should come at the cost of flavor and consistency.\n\nIf you work close by and you're really craving some cheap and fast Indian food that meets your dietary restrictions, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to come here, but if you have your choice of Indian restaurants, I'd definitely recommend choosing a different one.", "date": "2014-07-31 02:22:29"}

As per my usual, this review gets three stars. Not because there was anything lackluster about my experience, but because it gives me an opportunity to return in the future and perhaps add more stars.\nI arrived during a lull in morning service. This was great because I did not feel the need to rush through looking around, and taking in the menu which has many choices on it. My server Christine was appropriately welcoming and perky-and when I told her it was my first visit she was of course more than happy to answer any questions I might have and give me plenty of time to make my selection. I finally settled on the Irish omelette which contains corn beef hash and cheddar cheese, and because my omelette had potatoes with in it I elected for pancakes as my side paying an additional two dollars to upgrade to one of the many options of pancakes beyond buttermilk. I chose Pecan. \nAs I waited for my order, I took a few pictures, checked Facebook, and took time to enjoy the steaming hot cup of coffee that had been placed before me. Their coffee mugs are delightfully original, and if not for the fact that I already own enough coffee mugs to caffeinate a small nation I likely would have purchased a mug on my way out. The coffee brand here is Boyds, brewed fresh and strong. A tip here, if you prefer your coffee a little on the later side, be sure to ask for cream and be prepared to send it down just a touch. \nThe interior of The Original  Pancake House is a bit Spartan, however it is warmly painted and still manages to be welcoming. I cannot say as much for the chairs, they are the hard straight back wouldn't variety that don't invite for any prolonged resting of the buttocks .  With tile floors, and large windows the space was, at least this morning, a bit on the chilly side which made me glad that I had opted to leave my hoodie on.\nWhen Christine brought my food, I literally said wow out loud, actually I believe the actual word was wowzers! It is well known by anyone who spends any time with me that I am a big eater, however those of you with a more shall we say, normal size stomach should be prepared to take home a doggy bag. My pecan pancakes were beautifully golden brown and dusted with powdered sugar served on a separate plate from my Irish omelette. I was also left with a small picture of warmed syrup. At first glance my omelette definitely appeared to be overcooked, because it was. However given that it was jampacked with corn beef hash and cheddar cheese it is obvious that the extra cooking time was required. When Christine set down my plate I thought it first it may have been a mistake because this omelette didn't look like any other I have ever eaten, it looked more like a small loaf of sourdough bread. Not because of the color but because of the size . other than my omelette being a bit dry on the edges and of course being a little bit overcooked the only other issue I had is that the way the omelette have been folded I manually had to move melted cheese on to the corn beef once I cut into it in order to blend the flavors together. When I return again to eat here I will see if A different kind omelette comes from the kitchen in the same manner.\nAs the restaurant begin to fill, I watched the graceful ballet of servers busters and the hostess getting folks welcomed seated and served. My coffee cup never ran empty, my water was also regularly refilled. I especially appreciated how the busser made regular, yet inconspicuous tours of the dining area to make sure things were kept clear.\nWhen it came time for the check, I was pleased to find that it was not a printed receipt but I handwritten ticket, where all of The charges had been totaled at the bottom including the tax.\nI don't often go out for breakfast, my husband does not care for pancakes waffles or French toast, and has some sensitivity to eggs. So when I get an opportunity to go out I enjoy trying new places, especially now that I use Yelp it's much easier and I appreciate patronizing local businesses. I will go back to this location.  Since this restaurant appears to primarily please folks in the breakfast arena I will likely not test that theory by coming for any other type of meal. This was an amazing start to a clear, sunny and cold Friday in March. If you're looking for a freshly cooked, stick to your ribs, if you leave hungry it's your own damn fault breakfast give the Original  Pancake House a try", "date": "2015-04-03 15:53:59"}

Both times were positive interactions with great food.\n\nThe french toast burrito is PHENOMENAL, as is their veggie breakfast burrito (which is wonderfully huge, and mysteriously easy to finish). My green smoothie was quite good, as was the coffee. Neither drink was the absolute best we'd ever had, but both were in the higher tiers.\n\nI'm a fan of local, organic, and vegetarian, and this place hits all those marks, even having a little \"market area\", which sells soaps and whatnot. I do hope the resources are available so they could be a little more \"local, organic, and vegetarian-friendly\", without sacrificing their appeal to those meat-eating customers or those who think local and organic is just a passing fad. It's great to have this option close-by, however!\n\nI totally dig their owner's community-investment advocacy and how he's surely brought awareness to many about eating locally (and, fairly healthy). While eating-in, we noticed that the woman at the register (I don't recall her name, but she was a little older) is super-good at her job - gracefully handled a busy, hungry, (&, slightly buzzed) crowd as well as being an important team-player in the kitchen / behind the counter. She worked with the effortlessness and effectiveness of a Fairy Godmother! The young woman at the grill stayed calm and focused as she banged out one tasty burrito after another. Her loyal helper dutifully followed her direction, in order to get the meals to the hungry masses. The smoothie / coffee guy was as chill as Shaggy after some Scooby Snax, and very personable as he whipped up some 98% correct and 98% delicious drink concoctions. That 2% actually added to his charm! His super-awesome personality along with the uplifting experience of watching the well-oiled team happily serve a seriously never-ending line of customers more than made up for any minor nits I could pick in accuracy or taste. (Which I'm generally pretty picky about!)\n\nThe restaurant is on the corner, next to the railroad tracks. There are several small tables and lots of light from the large windows. The kitchen area is open and not much larger than a food truck. Kinda reminds me of an old-school, south philly, corner luncheonette. Has a similar vibe, with a \"hipster\" update (in a good way). I kinda dig that they serve on paper plates, but I do hope they're recycled or sustainably-sourced. I'm super-happy they deliver (especially breakfast - however, with that amazing french toast burrito, that's also a bit dangerous...). And, I'm happy that their menu has some really solid options for vegetarians and omnivores alike, including some creative smoothies and coffee drinks. I'm looking forward to seeing how they evolve their menu and their impact on the community. I'm definitely glad this place exists and will surely be back soon!", "date": "2016-05-08 17:48:39"}

We figured we do it up somewhere nice where we'd read quite a bit about great reviews and fancy dining. While the food was definitely good I can honestly say it probably wasn't worth the price.\n\nA member of our party had the shrimp and grits which he loved. The Grits were some of the best I ever tasted and were creamy to perfection. Another friend had the pork chop and really enjoyed it as well. It was a huge portion. Someone else had the barbecue shrimp which you definitely need a bib for and I'll give it to you, because the shrimp are hole and need to be peeled. While it seems like some extra work she definitely enjoyed her dinner and the sauce it came in she said was amazing. She ordered extra bread so she could stop up every last drop.\n\n Lastly another friend and I both got the soft-shell crab. This was probably the most disappointing of the meals for the night. While it was definitely tasty it probably wasn't worth the money it cost and honestly the sauce was a little dry. The other issue both of us had was that they're soft shell crab was on a bed of cooked mixed Peppers. The flavor of the pepper is in the soft shell crab and sausage did not really mix and neither of us enjoyed that part of the dish. For over $30 I probably would go back and get something else next time if I ever went back.\n\nThe drinks that we ordered were cocktail, and decent but not great. We ordered a crab cake appetizer which was just one crab cake and good but not the most amazing thing I've ever had.\n\nService was nice and you definitely get multiple servers in suits per table. It was clearly very busy and you definitely need a reservation to get their. But I was surprised since it was my 30th birthday but they didn't offer any sort of birthday dessert or even special attention.

It starts with the servers, bartenders and managers who always welcome me with a smile and a friendly \"how are you?\" or \"we haven't seen you lately\".   Because of that, Noble has quickly become my version of \"Cheers\", where everyone knows your name.  Needless to say, the staff always goes above and beyond to make all guests feel welcome. If there's ever a question or concern you can guarantee that Will, Jason or any other manager on that day will quickly attend and resolve the matter. \n\nOn top of the great staff the drinks and food are amazing! I've never had a bad meal, and I've tried most of the menu.  Many people may not be aware that all of their ingredients are locally grown and sourced, which makes each dish stand out from the competition. Also, the menu is constantly evolving based off the season and available ingredients, so there's plenty to try! \n\nIf you're looking for a classy, unique establishment, with excellent people in Wesley Chapel, this is the place for you!", "date": "2018-06-10 17:40:11"}

We arrived early for our reservation and they accommodated us, even though I said we would just wait at the bar until our reservation time. When I made the reservation I mentioned it was our anniversary and asked for a seat near the windows.  We were sat a tiny 2top right in front of the kitchen and server stand, smack in the middle of staff constantly whizzing by with food and dirty plates.  There were windows to the kitchen though, so I guess I got what I asked for. \n\nThe service was wonderful and my husband said his drink was the best he had in New Orleans.  \n\nThe food....eh.  I had the soup 1-1-1.  The soup of the day, artichoke & spinach was delicious, as was the seafood gumbo. But the gumbo ya ya? Bland. Really disappointing.   My husband had the crawfish risotto and it was so bad he could only choke down half.  I feel like the staff knows it's terrible because none of our three servers even asked if he wanted a box when they removed his plate full of food.   Onto the BBQ Shrimp.  It's a mess. A complete and total mess. But they help you with your bib, give you a ton of napkins, and a warm, moist towel and lemon to clean your hands.   Peeling is difficult because it's super hot. They give you a ton of shrimp. I don't remember how many I just remember being blown away by the size AND quantity.  As for the taste? They were just ok.  But the BBQ sauce? They should sell that as a dipping sauce with the bread. I'd eat an entire loaf of bread soaked up with that sauce. I'd almost order that again just for the sauce. Almost.  \n\nI might come back to try the shrimp & grits and the truffle fries, but with so many other places to eat, I don't know if I'd spend the money and risk another let down.", "date": "2016-05-21 15:41:30"}

Rose, nobody knows my name. I'll forgive them, though, because after I gorge myself on their juicy burger and luscious cheese fries, I don't even remember my name. In fact, that's probably why no one knows me -- my face is always buried in their food and subsequently covered in condiments.\n\nFor drink afficionados, I have two words: Beer. Selection. M.L. Rose has it. You'll find a deep lineup of bottles (and a few diverse drafts), as well as a delightful array of seasonal options. You can also treat yourself to some of the world's best beers, like Delirium Tremens and Chimay.\n\nIf you go to this grease factory, you must get the loaded cheese fries. Waffles, Wisconsin cheddar, whopping amounts of sour cream and chives...you'll love them and hate yourself afterward, especially if you've also ordered a burger. It'll be generously sized, too. \n\nIf you go to M.L. Rose and clean your plate, look for me. I'll be waiting with a high five, a beer and heartburn pills. I'm easy to find -- I'm the guy nobody knows.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is my favorite bar in town, but it doesn't get five stars. Two things hurt its rating: \n\n1) There aren't a ton of draft options. Bottles abound, but if you love a crisp draft, you'll get quality but not quantity. \n\n2) They recently turned the table-top back-room seating into booths with high dividers. It puts a damper on the atmosphere, especially during trivia night, when the interaction and people-watching used to be just as fun as the contest itself.\n\n**Second disclaimer: Go to Tuesday trivia.

Well that is of course if you head a little west to 12th ave. This place can get pretty packed so my advice is to get there early, which is all the more reason to take advantage of Happy Hour.  Nice selection of brews on tap, and there burgers are pretty good too. I consider myself a BURGERTARIAN, so it was nice to see they deliver some extra points by having local beef.  The burger was nicely seasoned, but just a smidge dry.  I even ordered it med-rare, so anything med or above would be travesty.  As far a service, our waitress was great, but i have been here and got crappy service behind the bar.  I think some of the bartenders try to hard to be edgy, and it comes across as rude.

Once we found our way through the nearly deserted building,we were greeted by the hostess and promptly seated. The dining area seemed poorly designed with little flow through, but the view was excellent (my date commented on the view from the restroom as unbelievable, but considering I'm not going into the ladies room to check it out, I'll just have to believe her). The service was also excellent, the wine selection decent, but maybe a bit pricey, and the food was quite good indeed. First time we went we had the \"set\" dinner with a fight of wines. I had the NY strip and my date had the Salmon... both were excellent. The second time we ordered ala' carte. I had the scallops and she had the Chicken. Again, well prepared and tasty. We shared the Humus plate, which we both enjoyed immensely. If you like humus and couscous go for it. The only fault I found with the menu was a lack in change. Okay, it was only two weeks between visits, but the set menu choices hadn't changed one bit, and neither had the ala' carte menu. I might be a bit picky, but I like to try different things.

What I failed to read was that it was actually a breaded calamari steak \"smothered\" with a \"lemon butter cilantro sauce.\" Smothered was right but, more aptly, it was drenched. Both texture and flavor were off the mark for me in this dish -- may be one of my last favorite bites in Reno; would not recommend. Sifting through the great spread of choices, I settled for the Mesquite Salad with chicken and shrimp. This was actually reasonably good. Only complaint would be that the shrimp was left on the grill for much too long. One piece in particular was especially charred and kinda ruined what could have been a pretty decent dish.\n\nOverall, I'm sure this is a solid place, especially with all of the drink specials considered.

She was also very knowledgeable about the items on the menu, and make several recommendations.  \n\nWe had the special appetizer not on the menu, \"eggplant Olivier!\"  Winners!  It was an excellent choice of generous slices of eggplant perfectly cooked, and smothered with an exquisite creole sauce with shrimp.\n\nMy wife had the blackened catfish, and I had the gumbo sampler.

The last time I was here on a Friday night there was a live duo on upright bass and piano plunking down some Sinatra tunes. The atmosphere really is perfect - I only wish the drinks and service followed suit. \n\nBeing a hotel bar, I sure get that prices will be steep. But not THIS steep, and certainly not this high considering none of the crafted cocktails ($12-13) we tried were particularly wonderful, let alone mindblowing. I'll give them credit for conjuring up cocktails inspired by various literary classics (e.g. \"The Last Word\", inspired by Bram Stoker's 'Dracula'). \"The Last Word\" is made with Beefeater gin, maraschino liqueur, lime & chartreuse. The drink was decent but the flavors just didn't meld right and felt like some element was missing. I felt similarly about \"The Moonstone\", which I was really excited for as it featured Pisco, one of my favorite liqueurs, but this also failed to deliver. I was especially disappointed when I saw our bartender shake out a butt ton of bitters to top the drink. Bitters are meant to be \"dashed\" with just a sprinkling...your drink shouldn't end up with a whole splatter of it. \n\nThe last straw was being charged $20 (TWENTY) for a pour of Balvenie 12 year. New York prices in St. Louis... NOT OKAY, hotel bar or not. $20 for a small pour even in NY would be a bit steep. \n\nI was pretty dismayed with the quality of our cocktails, and even more disgruntled at some pretty unprofessional behaviors from the staff behind the bar. If I am sitting at the bar and can hear and see the bartenders jostling with each other, exchanging some \"you know you're not supposed to ____\" followed by \"shut up\" and \"no, you shut up\"... something is not quite right.\n\nI'd be willing to give F&H another chance, maybe to try the food, get some of those yardstick beers and try a few more cocktails, esp. because I like the environment so much.

I tried a drink called a dark & stormy which to my knowledge was a mix of rum, ale, ginger, tonic, lime, and something else. Long and short, it was quite possibly the smoothest cocktail I have ever tasted. \n\nThe Food:\n\nThe food at this place is fairly exotic for a place in Indianapolis. They had some rye crackers that had beef that was off of a cows cheek. Sounds odd, but other than feeling like i was kissing the cows face, it was mighty tasty. They also make popcorn with bacon grease which makes for a different tasting popcorn to say the least. \n\nAll in all, cool place with a great atmosphere and environment.

For example, I will FedEx items to myself at the hotel that I will be staying, for hold pick up when I check in.  Since FedEx has a small office near the convention section, they have an agreement with Gaylord that item will not be sent to the hotel for pick up.  Instead you have to pick up at the onsite FedEx, and FedEx gets to add a 'handling fee' for holding the package.  \n6) $15 / day 'resort' fee a way to make pay high mark up for limited wi-fi service, limited to your room.

WOW! So good. 4 course meal (plus bread) for $35 each, plus tax and tip. If I had to do it again, I'd choose the Tarte de Legumes, the Saumon, and the Tart Tatin. Also, good-sized portions on everything! Not tiny little fancy portions.\n\nFOOD:\n--Delicious little warm rolls, served with an awesome pesto.\n\n--First course is a \"creamy truffle wild mushroom soup\"...those of us who got it were delighted. It was delicious if not a little weird-looking...Due to allergies, one in our party got a split pea and ham soup and the other a tomato red pepper bisque. Kudos to them for having substitutions (the waiter explained it's their vegetarian option as the mushroom one is no longer vegetarian), and both enjoyed their soups, but I personally didn't really like either of them.\n\n--Appetizer (8 options): We had the Calamars, the Tarte de Legumes, the Tartare, and the Salade Boston. I had the \"sustainably-harvested calamari stuffed with house-made proven\u00e7al sausage, fresh herbs, saffron rice, piperade, jus de legumes\"...I don't know why but I was expecting your more usual fried calimari, and I'm not a huge fan of fresh seafood, so I didn't particularly care for it. The other two who had it absolutely loved it though. I also tried the \"Tarte de Legumes: roasted eggplant caviar, caramelized onion, and red pepper tart with black olive and goat cheese tapenade, herb sauce, poached Sandy Ridge Farm egg\" and WOW was it delicious. The runny yolk, the tapenade was delicious, and the tart was a little mini cookie-but-not-a-cookie kind of phylo dough thing, a nice accompaniment, as was the bit of greens it was served with. The \"Tartare: fresh Scottish salmon, mango, basil, capers, black olives, cornichons, tomato, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and wonton crisps\" was apparently good, but was being eaten by a tartare conoisseur (6/10 on her scale). She said \"It had bigger chunks of salmon than a standard tartare, which makes it a little fishier tasting.\" The salad (\"Boston bibb lettuce with crumbled gorgonzola cheese, apple, walnut pralines, and walnut vinaigrette\") was well received: a sweet little salad. My only note on the salad is that it's not a real leafy salad. A couple large leafs of lettuce topped with the other stuff. Fancy salad.\n\n--Main course (8 options): We had the lamb (Agneau), steak (Bavette), scallops (Vol au Vent), and salmon (Saumon). The lamb was oh so tender, literally fall-off-the-bone. Even after removing all the fat/skin, there was plenty of meat for a good-sized entree. The mashed potatoes were also awesome. Carrots were fine, but I didn't notice any turnips. My friend had the steak and loved it, although we noted it was rather lukewarm if not on the cold side. She liked her mashed sweet potatoes and the green beans too. I personally, having tried all the dishes, would say this one was the least special, although still good. I think my favorite was the salmon (\"Saumon: pistachio and goat cheese-crusted Scottish salmon filet wrapped in phyllo, carrot pur\u00e9e, creamy Swiss chard, light turmeric and cumin sauce\"), although I can't say I tasted the goat cheese. It was just delicious salmon in delicious buttery phyllo. And finally, the scallops (\"Vol au Vent: butter-poached scallops in puff pastry with creamy Swiss chard and saffron mussel sauce\") were delicious as well. The sauce they pour over it (table-side) is a sauce made with cream and the juice that the scallops and mussels cook in. It was heavenly. The scallops aren't literally in the puff pastry. It's a puff pastry in the middle (my friend wished the pastry hadn't been soaked as it got soggy, so maybe ask your waiter to pour around it), with 4 good-sized scallops around it and lots of different little vegetables (I want to say I stole some okra off her plate but I could be completely wrong) that get drowned in the delicious sauce. Yum.\n\n--Dessert (4 options): We tried all except the profiteroles: the St. Tropez Cake (\"double-layer valhrona chocolate mousse cake with cr\u00e8me anglaise\"), the Tart Tatin (\"warmed French caramelized apple tart a la mode\"), and the Creme Brulee (\"caramelized vanilla bean flan\"). The cake was our least favorite by far. The bottom is like a spongy cake, and is not texturally-appealing, although the mousse part on top is good. Would not order it again. The Tart Tatin was delicious, although they were out of ice cream, so we got fresh whipped cream instead. I also wish it had been served a little warmer than it was (it was room temp), but it was just a simple little apple tart. Not too sweet, just simple. And the creme brulee was well executed.\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waiter was awesome. Funny and friendly and knew the menu very well. Asked us if we needed anything at a couple points throughout the meal. Water was always filled. My only complaint is the lady who seated us was cloyingly polite, it was annoying.\n\n---------\n\nGreat little place!", "date": "2012-02-01 04:18:14"}

Neither sandwich was as advertised. I suppose we should've left once we saw microwaves above the cooler of presliced meat, sadly we didn't see that until after we ordered. My spouse ordered the Corned Beef on Rye, whole sandwich that the cashier said was huge, at least two meals worth- Nope! The manager was making the food. He put presliced luncheon corned beef, NOT fresh corned beef brisket which you'd be expecting from all of the advertised pictures of delicious looking sandwiches and the claims of being a deli,  and proceeded to heat it up in the microwave. Eww! Never mind the perfectly good grill chillin right next to him. After a few seconds he pulled it out and set it on top of the microwave where there's a large cutting board while he prepped the other sandwich. The other sandwich was an Upper Eastside, made wrong according to the description which he was reading from the board while he made it so how he made it incorrectly blows my mind. There was no one in the place except us, two people, so there was zero rush. The Upper Eastside had toasted bread (it's a cold sandwich), was covered in onions (no onions in description) and it had no mushrooms on it. Back to the Corned Beef of Rye, it was the saddest corned beef ever. The top and bottom bread was coated with mustard, the bread was plain white bread, there was hardly any meat, very small sandwich for $12.89 and how someone could eat the salty, gray colored muck meat disgusting, sickening thing without vomiting is beyond me. I truly hate writing a bad review, especially on a local joint but please don't waste your time or money. Two terrible sandwiches, one of which was missing the pickle (come on man!) for $23...go somewhere good, there's tons of great places in Carrollwood!", "date": "2015-05-16 22:36:54"}

Let's start with the burgers... they are good. Very good. The beef is clearly freshly ground, they give you more choice of toppings than anywhere I have been so far, and the whole package comes together in a delicious way. The only complaint I have about the burgers are the buns; seriously the buns are too small to fit everything they put in them. I understand there's a certain charm to eating something so messy that it spills everywhere, but I usually reserve those times for things smothered in chilly or gravy, not just a regular burger. Although these aren't the best burgers I've ever had, they are definitely better than your run of the mill fast food joint. What really makes Five Guys a staple are their fries. The cajun fries are without a doubt the best fries I have had in my 22 years of fry eating experience. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, a perfect thick cut french fry covered in spicy Cajun seasoning... I think I'm in love. Oh, and I can only assume that the fry cup they give you is some source of great humour for the employees, since it is completely inadequate to house the massive portion of french fries that you must dig your burger out from under (not a complaint). I'd suggest sharing a fry portion with a like-minded chum. Definitely worth further investigation for those who have grown tired of traditional fast food fare.", "date": "2012-10-11 10:03:30"}

Oh, and filling out the card with those little pencils remind me of playing mini-golf... so I guess that's a bonus? I have had a few of the different options here and they are always good. The buns stand out as compared to many a burger I have tried. For one, they are actually an adequate size to contain the vast array of toppings one might decide to grace the burger with. Secondly, they are not just any old bun, you actually have a choice of many different \"gourmet\" buns.

If I'm with one or two people, I usually just grab a seat at the bar (you can order food there, too). Besides, you'll probably get your order faster that way.\n\nMy one beef with Jackson's is that the waitstaff (on the off-chance you're not at the bar) tends to go MIA at any given moment.

Hmm, okay, let me take a stab at it. \n\nI had bought a Groupon for Dawna Ara and it was soon to expire. So I tried calling but I didn't get a response. In the voicemail, she prompted to book via the website. You check the website and the only date that was available was the day after the Groupon's expiration date.\n\nHmm...Plan B.\n\nDecides to email her directly and email Groupon just in case I can't use it. Groupon responsed and said they would give me credit in Groupon money if I never used the deal. Dawna also responded and after exchanging a few emails, we had settled on a date.  So if you have problem getting through her, I would say email is the way to go.\n\nThe date arrived and finding this place wasn't too difficult via GPS. However, it's a residential building and does not have any company name posted. Look for the house with the little white fence.  I walked in and just saw candles lit and chairs with literature on the table. I also saw an Iphone but I figured that was hers. I was finally greeted by Dawna after what looks like the owner of the building came in and shut the door. \n\nDawna does everything herself. So there's a bit of a wait before, during, and after the session. This was my first time at acupuncture and I actually did feel something working immediately after I finished the treatment. I came in for multiple ailments but she concentrated on the main aspect of my problem. BTW, the treatment was relaxing since I was lying down for 30 minutes but the actual treatment was a little bit shorter than I expected compare to the other reviewers. Also the massage was a bit shorter than I expected. Nevertheless, this place should be tranquil enough after she updates it with some furnishings since it is really bare at the moment. Thus, not bad for the Groupon rate. Note to add, if you ever check out the bathroom, it feels a bit slanted.", "date": "2011-02-16 18:25:17"}

It makes for a good place to get some beers and watch football with the guys, and at least this place is a little more unique than some of the other ones around.\n\nI made it here on a Friday night to meet with a group of 10 friends. They had a large table reserved for us, and we were seated quickly. The place is really cool inside, with a lodge vibe that looks like something you would see up in the mountains. It was large, and it wasn't very full the one time I was here. There are more than enough TVs to see whatever sporting event you want to watch without having to turn your head very far.\n\nTheir menu consists of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and a surprising selection of dinner entrees. We ended up with a few appetizers that were pretty good, and a whole bunch of wings. I went with their \"smoked and grilled\" bone-in wings, which were phenomenal. I got them with sauce, but I would probably just get them plain with a sauce on the side since they were that good. They were some of the best wings I've had in the city. That being said, they were also pricier than most, but at least you get what you pay for.\n\nI was surprised to see a decent selection of good local beers on tap. They also had a couple beers under the Twin Peaks brand, and quite a few of the largely distributed craft beer brands. And of course, you can always get an ice cold glass of light domestic stuff as well. \n\nService, especially considering we had such a large group, was fantastic the entire time we were eating and drinking. Drinks never went empty before getting a refill and our food came out much quicker than expected. Unfortunately, for some reason that we never figured out, our server went MIA as we were wrapping up and we had to wait around a while before we could actually ask for checks. At least we were done, so the empty glasses and plates in front of us didn't need refilled, but it was still frustrating to be stuck there as we were ready to leave. If it wasn't for that snafu, the service would have gotten 5/5.\n\nI don't have as much of a bias against large chain restaurants as the rest of Yelp tends to have, and I was very happy with what we ended up with out of this place. The food was great, our service was almost great, it is a neat place and there are lots of TVs, the beer list was probably the one shortfall and even it wasn't that bad.

I chose to add pimento cheese. Once again, I chose the waffle fries as my side. This burger was really good. Although I have to admit I was a little disappointed... Out of the 3 angry dragons at my table, mine was the only one whose fried egg was overcooked! Both of my friends had runny yolk and mine was completely cooked through. Wahh!

We kept coming back because they're the only Mexican restaurant right in Victorian Square (downtown Sparks) and ends up being the place that we end up with big groups of people that can't agree on other places to eat. The location is great and the place is actually nice, but the service has been between just passable and the worst ever.\n\nOne of our good friends is a regular at this restaurant and really enjoys the Chingalingas (deep fried burritos). She insisted that we stop in here before we went to see Kung Fu Panda. My wife and daughter showed up just after 4pm and waited for 10 minutes before someone even came to seat her. They were seated inside. (There were about 5 or 6 full tables outside on the patio.) Her friend and her daughter showed up 5 minutes later and sat with her. They asked for menus then 10 minutes later the menus finally showed up. So they ordered their drinks. The kids got the drinks almost immediately, then a few minutes later the moms got their drink. They placed the food orders at this time. Then the hubbies showed up a few minutes later, just before 5pm (me and our friend's husband). Chips and salsa were brought to the table after the food order was placed.\n\nThe chips were stale--and they even went through the hassle of breaking them up into small pieces for us. How thoughtful! The salsa was ok, slightly watered down.\n\nSo we kept looking into the kitchen and saw 7 or 8 people working frantically preparing meals. We assumed they were preparing our meals. At 5 after 5 we asked if our food would be out soon. Our server went back to the kitchen and came back to tell us our order was the next one on the line. Huh?!? It had been 25 minutes since the food order was placed and they hadn't even started preparing our dishes yet?? C'mon, I've been the tons of Mexican restaurants and it ain't that hard to throw together a plate of carnitas!\n\nWe were now 20 minutes from start time for our movie so there was no way we would make the movie if we stayed. So we all got up and asked for our bill. We told him we had to go because we already bought our movie tickets. The owner came over and apologized and comped the drinks that were on the bill (the least he could've done). As we were walking out (at 5:15pm--ONE HOUR after my wife first walked in) he came up to my wife and said our bill shows that we were only there 25 minutes. Um, no, 25 minutes was how long our food order was sitting on the line waiting to be started!! What a jerk. And this guy is the OWNER!\n\nFirst rule in the service industry, the customer is always right. Second, how dare you stop a customer on the way out to tell them they were wrong??\n\nWe were the only table inside. The place was dead. You think they would be grateful and falling over themselves to gain and retain any business they can get. That wasn't the case.\n\nIn past visits, the food was pedestrian Mexican. Nothing really had any distinct flavors. Everything was either coated in cheese or sour cream and it all just blended together. Blah. I never got sick after eating there so that's why I gave them one star, otherwise this would be a zero-star review.\n\nI gotta say, I was indifferent about this restaurant before tonight--I would eat there but I wouldn't go out of the way to eat there. But after tonight's experience we will NEVER go there again. And our friends--who regularly ate there--will also NEVER go there again.\n\nInsider tip: don't even bother with this restaurant, go to Great Basin Brewery instead (a couple doors down).", "date": "2008-06-07 05:19:18"}

My primary complaint is that when you are paying $13.50 for an acai bowl, I expect it to be a quality bowl. A quarter of the bowl was composed of very unripe, hard, bitter bananas. When I mentioned this to the worker, she said they knew the bananas were unripe. I'm not sure why they made a bowl knowing that one of the main ingredients was not up to their normal standard. On top of that, she was not apologetic and did not seem to really care that our experience was subpar. In addition we waited about 30 minutes for the bowl and left hungry because the majority of the bowl was the green bananas. Hoping their quality control and customer service improves some, because I want to like this place, although we probably won't be back any time soon:(", "date": "2015-09-12 18:06:58"}

However, since the food is always good, and the Owner/Manager on duty has since apologized, Im inclined to give it a solid 4 star.\n\nThey get mega points for authenticity and taste. I lived in Chicago for a few years, and got to experience great Greek cuisine. One owner of one such restaurant there said that if it didn't taste iike home everytime, he would pack up and leave. And most of the food here is on par with that. \n\nI've chosen to largely forgive the service I received on my latest visit, because ignoring the issue (since resolved) with the Owner/Manager, the cashier/service people who I talked to before the issue were great! They were very helpful and eager to take my order. \nI had initially gone in to inquire about this locations history and the experience these two were having  here as compared to their previous jobs, and to order something small for the road.  To which they had only good to say about the owners and the conditions. \n\nThere are two other things that I think they could improve on. One, the locations appearance. Im not going to judge it too much, because in our current economy small business owners have to be conscientious about space rent and such. However, a remodel or some painting or brightening up would probably go a long way. \nThe other is a better drink selection/ self service. I think they might benefit from a fountain machine for drinks, like the Gyro Co. down on baumgartner and meramec bottom. Again, I won't really hold this against them because I'm not aware of the cost management of that vs. what they currently do. \n\nOverall: This is a great authentic eatery. Im glad that the owner(s) are able to keep going during these times when it's hard to do so.", "date": "2014-12-18 22:54:15"}

The hotel caters to whatever convention is going up on which is great for them  but then the other paying customers are seriously deprived of all the resources they are paying good money for because they are blocked off for convention members only even though we are paying the same or higher cost.

We had chargrilled oysters and Rockefeller for appetizer. Entree: 2 lobster pasta, crawfish etouffee, 8oz filet mignon, chicken Caesar salad,  crab cakes, and Mac and cheese. The sad part is no one liked their food. Lobster pasta tasted like they just dumped a can of tomato paste in the pasta and mixed it into the linguine and the lobster was over cooked which caused it to be chewy. Crawfish etouffee was too salty. Filet mignon tasted like a over cooked sirloin it came with potatoes and vegetables that look like the whole plate been sitting under the light for a long time. As for the chicken caesar salad the chicken was so dry and it had way too much dressing on the plate and it was too creamy. Crab cakes barely had any crab in it and it was just full of stuffing. We ordered Mac and cheese for my niece and it looked like it was made from a Kraft box and dried. My niece usually eats her Mac and cheese and this time she ate a little bit and didn't want it. We spent over $200 and left this restaurant having to go eat at another restaurant right after. For the first time ever that my family had to do that. Very disappointing.

On a whim we looked into \"Bistro\" type spots in VC and stumbled onto this absolute gem. Totally tucked away from the noisy and tourist trap that's Main Street of VC, Cider Factory is one street \"up\" from Main Street, close enough to walk, but far enough you'd feel like your a 1000 miles away. The staff, amazing. Gracious and hardworking. The food (think Italian cuisine) is so well done and unbelievably delicious. Side story: we just returned from San Fran this week and while there had Fiore de italia (oldest Italian restaurant in the US) and our meals at Cider totally blew them out of the water, no contest. \n\nNot only is the experience amazing, the people are as well. Family owned is a thing of the past, and my wife and I seek out smaller spots for this reason. The fam at Cider is nothing short of perfect. Only two total people working (host and waiter) on a busy Saturday, and we were never short on food, drinks, conversation or service. Great work guys!\n\n-If you're doing dinner we totally recommend the patio. \n-Try the Moscato it's amazing.\n-While not on the dinner menu we had, I ordered Buffalo blue cheese alfredo (chef totally accommodated my request) and it was to die for.\n\nSo, make Cider Factory a MUST do on your next Virgina City trek.

When the management learned of our experience, they invited us back to make it right, so we came back on our anniversary. \n\nI cannot begin to describe how overwhelmed we were that night.  What actually happened, is something my wife and I didn't expect.  \n\nFirst of all, we were upgraded to a junior suite at check in.  Wow - the suite was amazing, had plenty of room and a great view.  Within minutes of our arrival, we had our second surprise in the form of champaign and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room! At this point we were past the point of overwhelmed, and I haven't even gotten to dinner yet.\n\nWhen we arrived at the Old Hickory Steakhouse, we were seated at an excellent table on the terrace with a view of the gardens.  Our waiter, Andrew, was fantastic.  I never even pulled out the certificate you left us or told him who we were.  He knew right away and gave us our final surprise - he informed us that our entire meal with comped!  The then went on say that in situations like this, he recommended (with our consent) a \"chef's choice\" dinner.  To sit back, relax, and let the chef send out a few courses and enjoy.  Being in the restaurant business ourselves, my wife is very much a \"foodie.\"  She was in heaven.  The meal was fantastic.\n\nYou made our 5 year anniversary absolutely amazing, and just saying thank you somehow seems inadequate.  You didn't just make things right, you went far above and beyond anything we could have asked for.  I can only describe it as a \"wow\" experience.\n\nI will, of course, re-write my review and plan to write multiple reviews for not only the hotel but the restaurant as well.  I will be sure to word it in a way that describes the experience without all the background details, as I wouldn't want people to write a bad review for the purpose of getting something out of it (it certainly wasn't what we expected).\n\nI've learned over time that business (especially in Nashville) isn't about \"the deal,\" but about building relationships.  Thank you for what you did; this is by far one of the best \"romantic evenings\" my wife and I have experienced.  I believe we will have to come back and do it more often.", "date": "2015-02-04 22:24:13"}

As an omnivore, biting into tofu where I'd normally get meat is pretty much always a downer, but at Blue Sage Grille, the food is designed to be focused on vegetables from start to finish. \n\nA large contingent of the dishes at Blue Sage are of south-western or Asian inspiration but they are not simply familiar recipes minus the meat. The staff at Blue Sage have concocted a menu of interesting and creative entrees that utilize fresh vegetables, grains, and legumes in a variety of ways. I've yet to get a dish that has disappointed me. The menu changes from time to time (they don't have the Chinese 5-spice dumplings anymore), but I hope they never get rid of the BBQ Summer Rolls because I could inhale those things non-stop if given the opportunity. \n\nThe food has always been beautifully presented and the service impeccable. The servers are educated in the cuisine and can offer great recommendations and the pace of the meal has always been spot-on.\n\nOne other aspect that I enjoy about Blue Sage Grille is that since it is a rather small dining room, it is easy to strike up a conversation with the diners next to you. This restaurant seems to attract a rather eclectic clientele and several times we've met and talked to very interesting people about topics ranging from baseball to local politics. \n\nIf you find yourself in Lower Bucks County, go to Blue Sage Grille and treat yourself to one of the best dining experiences in the area.", "date": "2008-12-24 21:08:18"}

The place was fairly empty on a Tuesday at 7pm. I've heard it's packed on weekends, so perhaps going on off-nights is key. \n\nWe started off with the Bricklayer, a fancy name for extra delicious nachos that are topped with queso, avocado cream, olives, and jalape\u00f1os. The salsa that comes on the side is awesome - super fresh, flavorful, and not too watery. This is a big appetizer and probably a bit too much for two girls before dinner. If I ordered it again, it would be as a bar snack rather than an app. \n\nFor dinner, I had to try the Bird & the Pig. Wow - that pressed sweet bread combined with the salty bacon and chicken, paired with crisp apples and agave nectar? Yeah, the distinct flavors come together nicely to create one hell of a sandwich. \n\nI tasted my friend's black bean burger and liked that, too. \n\nThe only thing I tasted that didn't blow me away was the roasted potato salad I got on the side.

Three stars, according to Yelp, mean 'A-OK'.  Maybe B minus-OK in my estimation.\nLocals will remember past culinary iterations in this space that were just meh.\nFor starters, the space is handsome but with some kitschy touches that will wear thin over time.  Whetstone has the look of a first post-grad project conceived by a marketing/restaurant design major.\nThe bar is smaller now when compared to the prior tenant's design, and this is because of the addition of a crudo/cheese station.  This concept is a culinary peeve for me, since ANYONE can pull together an excellent crudo/cheese plate at home for a fraction of the cost.  You can, Blanche.  You can.  \n\nMoving along.\n\nA particular aspect about this place that the current and previous owners keep failing to address is the lack of noise-abating construction materials.  At points, it was too loud with the place only half full.  A particularly chatty threesome ten feet away really drove that point home. \n\nThis city is full of trendy places like this, and Whetstone, like all the rest, unfortunately fails to take the extra steps to create a marginally more quiet dining experience.  Skip this place on weekends if you hate the din as much as I do.\n\nOnward.\n\nMy partner had the Caesar Salad, and I had the Whetstone salad, both of which were plentiful and quite good.  Only complaint is that the croutons in both were well past their prime and inedible.  Zero crunch.  Tough as licorice.\nMy partner had the seared Icelandic cod with clams (6 oz if that matters to you...), and he said it was a four-star dish.\nOn to my burger, listed as 'Dad's Burger' on the menu.  It was offered as a single patty (about 4-5 oz according to our server), or double patty (about $3 more) of La Frieda beef, which is a well-regarded meat purveyor.\nOk.  I get it.   Americans frequently ruin hamburgers by mashing the heck out of them with a spatula on a barbecue.  And yes, fattier is tastier, and cooking over a barbecue grill unfortunately lets all that unctuous goodness drip through the grill into oblivion.\nHowever, the Dad's Burger, in spite of its carnal pedigree, was just plain drippy bovine bloviation that overwhelmed the meager bun and made me pine for the much-lauded burger at Rouge on Rittenhouse.  \nWhatever toppings were on the Dad's Burger just got lost in the muck.  We all know that a proper burger is a thick, gently packed thing of beauty with some juice in evidence.  Not here, however.\nI opted for the fries (half salad is also offered), which were just too friggin' salty.  Oversalting is a given here, as much as anywhere else, so no surprise.\nI may give Whetstone another try, but there is nothing new going on here.", "date": "2015-08-02 03:44:21"}

Not as famous as some, but just as delicious. Naturally, I was very eager to take my girlfriend there a week or so ago. We're greeted nicely, seated promptly, and served relatively quickly. We ordered the shrimp cocktail appetizer, the signature rabbit dish (one of my favorites on their menu), and the fried catfish and jambalaya. The only thing that was cooked properly and actually delicious was the shrimp cocktail (really, how hard is it to make a cocktail sauce and boil some shrimp, though?). The rabbit that arrived came with a side of some kind of rice and steamed carrots. The rabbit was overcooked, stringy, and damn near inedible. The rice was overcooked to the point where it was practically a mound of mush. The steamed carrots were just that: steamed carrots (nothing special). The fried catfish was fine but nothing special at all. However the jambalaya was dry and just poor. I've had both of these dishes before, they were fabulous both other times I've been to this restaurant: tender, delicious, cooked expertly, etc. I stayed in a Bed and Breakfast and the jambalaya they served at breakfast one more was superior in every way to this dish...and that was free. I ate the catfish and jambalaya nonetheless, but my girlfriend and I both agreed that the rabbit needed to be sent back (neither of us has ever sent food back to the kitchen anywhere); it was easily the worst meal I had ever tasted at such a \"high caliber\" restaurant. It was something that I might have expected to receive at a pub.\n\nSo we sent it back. The waitress was very nice and asked if we wanted something else instead. My girlfriend ordered the salmon and crab cakes instead. The crab and salmon cakes arrived and were edible as it's nearly impossible to screw up something that is fried (but again, this was nothing special and really not that great). The potatoes that came with them were just potatoes; essentially they were either boiled are steamed without any spices whatsoever. All three dishes we received were below par or worse. What's worse is that no manager came by to apologize. It would have taken less than a minute to ask if there anything he could do or simply just apologize for our dissatisfaction with the food. Not a peep. The rabbit was comp-ed but we were charged for the salmon and crab cakes which were more expensive. No comp-ed food (except what was unacceptable and sent back), no apology, no complimentary dessert, no anything. We spent $100+ (w/ a bottle of wine) on three dishes and an appetizer for a decent app and three terrible dinners. I would have rather eaten bar food. We paid the bill and got up to leave. No one said anything to us as we left. \n\nThis entire experience was heartbreaking for me. I can't even imagine what happened to this restaurant. It's not difficult to not overcook meat and/or rice. If the rabbit wasn't up to par, it shouldn't be served. Certainly they've cooked these dishes thousands of times. They know how they should come out. I am still baffled. It's like I'm in crazytown giving Olivier's a 1-star out of 5. This is just my most recent experience. I can assure you it will be my last. I'd rather spend my time at Jacques Imo's or Galatoire's and I can't justify paying this amount of money for a dinner that might come out like this.\n\nI hope they can turn things around. It's unacceptable for this kind of restaurant with such a history to phone it in like this.\n\n\nUPDATE: Sent this review through Olivier's website in addition to Yelp. The owner (Armand Olivier) replied to my email with deep regrets. He thanked me for my candidness and seemed deeply upset by this information. Perhaps the variability evidenced by many of these Yelp reviews was unknown to him. I appreciate the response and have bumped my review to 2 stars.", "date": "2012-01-06 00:20:30"}

Since it was our first night in NOLA, we ordered a round of the house made Hurricane-- not a go-to drink generally but I thought it was strong and tasty (but maybe had too much cherry liqueur).  The gumbo appetizer was probably the highlight of the meal-- each was sooo delicious!  I ordered the Taster's Platter-- a fried combo of fish, shrimp, a crab & salmon cake with greens and red beans.  The fried food was cooked well and not greasy since it was battered lightly with corn meal.  Pretty good but all the fried food became one note and I couldn't distinguish one from the other after a few bites.  The cakes were bland and mushy-- I didn't like them at all.  The collard greens and red beans though were well seasoned and tasty.  My friends liked their dishes: the roast duckling and New Orleans Classic Trio, and both tasted better than mine.

Ordered couple of iced teas and water ( very hot day) then we got a grilled shrimp Caesar salad and the mussels. Food came quickly enough, both Dishes pretty good. I give the food a solid 3. Our server was john and he was great! Kept the water and teas full, which is saying a lot. I had a minimum of four. Refills ( said it was hot) which John took care of without asking! Blows me away. Always checked back and brought extra bread for me to lap up the mussel broth. To top it off john brought us two teas to go when he brought me the check! Outstanding service.", "date": "2013-10-07 00:22:43"}

A nice little crowd, but not loud and bustling (well, until we got there at least...). The ambiance was lovely and the restaurant had a front \"bar\" area and a back eating area that was larger than I expected it to be. Of course, the lights were set to \"romantic\" mode (as they are in most Italian restaurants) and so I apologize in advance for the poor quality of my photos.\n\nFirst things first, we decided to order a couple of bottles of wine [priorities are important]. We were tickled to find that the wine list was longer than the list of food--so we had plenty of options. We got one bottle of red and one bottle of white and both were very tasty.\n\nSince we figured that drinking our dinners wasn't a smart or grown up thing to do, we ordered salads to start the meal. They were pretty standard \"house\" salads. Though, one twist was that it had provel cheese on it--which normally I am not a fan of; however, combined with the crisp lettuce and sweet red onions I didn't mind it one bit.\n\nNext was the main course. I ordered the lasagna and it was a-ma-zing. Like, melt-in-your-mouth, moan at the dinner table good. It had sooo much cheese. You can't go wrong with cheese, in my personal opinion.\n\nIt was served with two pieces of garlic toast that had a nice crunch to them and I really enjoyed eating a bite of my lasagna on a piece of my garlic toast. It was straight-up comfort food and I am certain that it was extremely fattening. But, who are we kidding, you can't eat that much cheese without expecting a few extra calories, right? \n\nAround the dinner table, the rest of the girls all got some sort of pasta dish and ordered half sizes, which seemed like a perfect sized  meal (especially if you had gotten a salad as well). Everyone claimed that their food was very good; however, I didn't hear the other girls moaning about their food like I was (though, maybe I'm just overly passionate about it...?).\n\nNeedless to say, I'd recommend the lasagna if you ever get a chance to stop by. In fact, I'm going to be so bold as to say that 1) that lasagna was the best lasagna I've ever eaten and 2) you are a fool if you get anything else! (Unless you are lactose intolerant... then, by all means, avoid the cheese-coma that is inevitable if you eat this meal.)\n\nI would also recommend that you go when you have a little extra time. Although it didn't bother me, a few of the girls noted that the service was a bit slow [especially considering that the restaurant wasn't very full]. I think we had sat at the table for a good 30 minutes before ordering our food. Then again, we had ordered wine... so who really noticed? Plus, if you've ever been to Italy you know that getting a waiter to help you there is like some sort of Olympic challenge. Italians are just a little more leisurely than Americans are (or... a LOT more, to be honest). So, perhaps Ricardo's simply likes to provide a truly cultural Italian dining experience.\n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed the meal at Ricardo's and would definitely recommend it to a friend. So, next time you're in the Square, be sure to check it out!", "date": "2011-11-03 20:00:22"}

The only drawback was our waiter who was more than a little pretentious.  In that vein, I'll follow suit and quote Oscar Wilde:  \"Life is too important to be taken seriously.....\". This place seems to have gotten rave reviews from a lot of people and maybe it's gone a bit to their head - or perhaps just to our waiter's head.  The \"story\" is the 1920's mixology which is unique and interesting but at the end of the day it's not \"fun\" unless the story includes the guest.  We asked a few questions about the drink menu and the answers we got were borderline condescending.  One member of our party eschews alcohol (but was a good sport and wanted to join our group for a nice dinner).  She asked about non-alcoholic drink options and she got a response from our waiter that seemed to ooze with \"why did you come here?\" as he offered a list of Coca Cola products and eventually sneered \"Oh, you mean a mocktail?\"  Instead of offering to have something fun created, he made the moment awkward, which was unfortunate.  They have a really nice dinner menu and some people probably DO come more for the food than the drinks.  The drink menu reminded me a bit of the drink menu at the Chandelier Bar at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas, but there the wait staff was fun and helpful answering questions - not stuffy and serious.  \n\nDespite the less than perfect waiter the food was delicious.  The halibut had a nice sear to it and was just the right amount of \"done\" in a sauce that had just the right balance of savory and sweet.

A few ceviche, Arroz con Mariscos and Anticuchos de Carne. I don't know what they marinate this beef in but it is amazing. It was getting testy who was getting the last piece of carne. ;-)\n\nThe only knock on this visit was the service was a bit slow and they were out of two wines we selected from the wine list.

I was determined to save my ever growing appetite for that meal - even skipping breakfast.  We started with a salad & some fresh cornbread, which were both great.  The three entrees she chose for her menu were: jambalaya w/fried catfish, poulet au fromage, & shrimp creole.  My other sister & I went the jambalaya/shrimp creole route - 'borrowing' from each other's plates as we've always (lovingly) done.  \n\nThe food was good - albeit, expectedly,  a little mild on the spices.  I frequently make shrimp creole at home, so I tend to prefer my own.  I loved the jambalaya & catfish - in fact, I'd like some right now.  I had some merlot; and, then, another glass of an obscure blush wine.  I thought I was set for the evening after that....\n\nI'm never prone to using profanity, but the bread pudding here = obscenities!!!  Maybe I need to add a star to their rating.

Last, but the worst: the entertainment console has a strange modern light that will make your room as bright as sunrise in the middle of the night. Four shirts and a suitcase could not block it. No switch to turn it off. Our view was two ports-potties in a mud field. We will never stay hear again.

We ordered the lobster pasta which was yummy - the meat could've been more tender but it was flavorful. My bro and his gf ordered the rock crab (comes with clam chowder, salad and onion rings) which was delicious but took ages to eat, as everyone can attest it's not the easiest food to crack into (pun not intended lol). My dad ordered the abalone on tomato basil rice. I don't eat abalone but the rice was good although a little on the salty side.

It's not the best decor I've ever seen but is unique nonetheless.\nThe prices at this place are very affordable. They do have a large menu (apart from a separate lunch menu) that contains everything from empanadas to pasta. The thing I liked about their menu was that they had at least 15 items separately listed on a 'vegetarian' section of the menu. That is always helpful for vegetarians. \nI had ordered a lamb gyro with a side of home-made chips off the lunch menu. The gyro was served on an open pita with a generous dose of Tzatziki sauce (Which I love). The lamb meat was well cooked and the whole dish was quite filling. The only thing I would criticize were the potato chips that were served on the side. They had zero seasoning and hence were bland and some of the chips had lost their crunchiness/crispness, which leads me to believe that they chips are just being held in an open container somewhere in the kitchen.\nOverall, a nice new place to have tried out.

My steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The pear salad was delicious, having the right balance of cheese, dressing and pear. The seafood gumbo and redfish garnered rave reviews from others in my party.\n3. The setting of the restaurant is also very relaxed.

We showed up about ten minutes early to our reservation and grabbed a drink at the bar.  The drinks were pretty much par for any upscale restaurant's bar...a bit pricey and good but nothing clever or great.  The atmosphere of the bar is a bit crowded making it loud and a little unpleasant.  Still, the clientele and the bar itself was nice so this wasn't a big deal.\n\nWhen we were seated, I was FREEZING.  I thought it was from my martini, but  I realized about half way through my meal when I stood up to navigate the corn maze to the bathroom downstairs that there was a vent blowing freezing cold air right above me.  Oh well.  On to the food....\n\nI started with Gumbo Ya-Ya, which is this places staple.  It did for sure live up to all it's hype.  I'm no gumbo expert but this had a delicious, rich and smoky flavor, that was very well contrasting with the natural sweetness of the chicken and broth.  It balanced smoky, salty, and sweet in excellent layers.  I ordered a scallops appetizer because I didn't want anything fried (seriously what's the deal...only like 1/7 appetizers wasn't fried).  I knew my entree would be heavy so I opted for this, and it wasn't a great dish.  The fried oysters and shrimp were much more flavorful.\n\nMy entree was the braised rabbit which was a really nice dish.  It was almost unfairly sweet and about half way through it it just felt like I was forking through molasses.  I really was moving at a New Orleans pace.  I think this might have worked better as an appetizer because at this quantity it felt like there was no beginning and no end.  The bacon and mashed potatoes were delicious, but were all hampered by a very very sweet and thick sauce.  The filet was okay (but nothing great), and the fish of the day was pretty nice, but also nothing great, from trying off of other plates.\n\nOverall, I think the food was four stars, but the limited dishes under 5,000 calories, the packed bar, and the freezing cold atmosphere detracted a star from my review.", "date": "2010-12-01 16:11:39"}

Not the best sign.  The wait staff was friendly, and the atmosphere is nice.  That is pretty much the only nice thing I can say about this restaurant.  The food - starting with the guacamole - had zero flavor.  I am not sure how you can even mess guacamole up, it's so easy to make.  My son ordered two soft tacos with brisket and nothing else on them - they literally had 2 slices of brisket each - and in his words \"taste like nothing\"...those 2 tacos cost $11.  That's crazy.  The kids menu provides an $6.95 entry for kids, but charges extra for a DRINK.  Why?  That's just tacky.  Everything on the menu is alacarte, so if you want rice and beans, be prepared to pay more for those.  My husband had the taco flight - 3 different tacos, and this is a guy who never would turn food down.  He said they had absolutely zero flavor - and wound up only eating a few bites.  We joked that they definitely do not have Mexican chefs - there is no way authentic Mexican food should ever be so bland and unseasoned.  Would not recommend.  Totally overpriced, as well.

Unfortunately, I'm bummed out that of all the places we could have gone for dinner..we ended up here. Very disappointed with the experience.\n\nTo find this place you have to walk all the way to the end of Stearn's Wharf which is no big deal because we were already there.  By no means is this the only restaurant in the area but since we were on the wharf I pulled it up on Yelp and it had many, many favorable reviews. So we thought...let's give it a shot.  \n\nUpon arrival, you place your name on a list hanging from the post just outside the entrance to the restaurant.   You can indicate eating indoors, at  one of the few tables outdoors, or first available.  We were in no rush and it was a nice afternoon so we opted for outdoors.  The restaurant is very small with even fewer tables outside. Service was below par.  The waiter even apologized and self-admitting he \"forgot about us\" after leaving us for 10 minutes and not returning to take our order.\n\nThe menu is typical seafood with specialization in crab and lobster. My two kids were with me and unfortunately their taste buds aren't at the level to pick from the menu. I asked the waiter if they offered a kids'  menu...they got three choices chicken dinos, grilled cheese sandwhich, or pasta. I opted for the crabcakes and my husband for the shrimp tacos.\n\nI wish I had read Steve I's review...I couldn't agree more with his description of the crab cakes.  I would assume that if you are calling a dish \"crab cakes\" that there would be some crab in it? Maybe?  They were a mushy mess.  Could not find lumps of crab nor taste the crab.  I won't complain about the skimpy size since it would have been a complete waste of \"food\".  The \"crab\" cakes came with a garnish of onion rings and a side of coleslaw.  The chipotle aioli tasted more like thousand island dressing.  On to the shrimp tacos.  Anyone who has had baja style shrimp tacos knows that they are breaded. In fairness to Sta Barbara Shellfish Co., the menu did not state they would be breaded.  According to my husband, they were just \"aw-right\".  From my vantage point across the table his plate did NOT look appetizing.  A side of box quality spanish rice to complement the tacos?!  The best thing about this place?  Getting the heck out!!!Overall, never coming back.", "date": "2012-10-09 20:30:58"}

There's an expansive bar, plenty of seating and also a patio for those wanting to people watch during lunch. \n\nWe came to Carmine's from Scottrade watching the Blues loose to the Flyers - great action at an exceptional venue. Carmine's was recommended to us by the cab driver and a fine recommendation it was.\n\nOur server was prompt and handed us a couple of menus - the alcohol menu was fairly extensive with four pages covering the various wines, house drinks and beers - I selected a quite good Deschutes Brewery Obsidian Stout and my dining companion went for a glass of red.\n\nThe food menu featured some interesting appetizers, Salads, Chicken, Steaks/Chops and Seafood. What intrigued me was the local favorite fried ravioli and we decided to split the appetizer (note that I had been warned that this local treat was \"disgusting\" - not my words). After trying it, I'm sorry but I simply can't recommend it here (and I'm betting that it's very well done at Carmine's). For me, the issue with the fried ravioli is that it contains beef - I think that if it were chicken or something a bit less fatty it would be fine. As it is, when you cut into the ravioli you're greeted by a greasy meatball surrounded by a lightly breaded ravioli pasta. The marinara did little to cut the grease and after eating one I couldn't stomach a second. Oh well, I was warned!\n\nFor dinner I selected the 10 oz Filet Mignon, inquiring about getting it black-and-blue (cold, rare guts with a bit of char on the outside). For a side I chose the broccoli sans the cheese sauce. The steak, while it could have had a bit more char it was indeed perfectly cooked temperature-wise. The broccoli wasn't anything special (maybe the cheese would have improved the dish? I almost asked for it on the side). I was passed a plate of mushroom risotto which was much better - I was just trying to save some of the calories and have something green.\n\nOverall, I thought the steak was just about perfect, the sides mediocre and the appetizer yucky. However, based on the excellent beer and the steak, I still think this restaurant is worth visiting and giving a try, especially if you happen to be downtown. Also, the service was excellent - I don't remember the server's name but she was quick, answered our questions and was very patient with a couple of visitors.\n\n(also published to my food blog)", "date": "2015-12-25 13:43:37"}

I would recommend the Bennie, a Bock german malty lager.  I had probably the most amazing beer cheese soup I have ever had.  My co-worker had this amazing pasta with sundried tomatoes and pine nuts.

Somebody else was eating farther down the bar and whatever he was having smelled excellent.\n\nMy only gripe is with the prices, which are on the high side.

It was sent back and no manager ever came out to apologize. It wasn't until we got the bill and noticed there was no adjustment and I asked to speak with the manager. It is also to be noted that we were the only people in the restaurant, so there was no excuse as to why anything would be undercooked. The manager then came out and said this was the first he had heard of the chicken being undercooked and it seemed as though he was blaming the young waitress as to why he didn't apologize. He then said that sometimes things like this happen, as if that is an appropriate response. He then said he was sorry and didn't even offer to adjust the bill. He said he would give us a free pizza, which would only be 12 dollars when the chicken was 23. My mom said she wanted the bill adjusted. He said he would see what he could do. He then came back and said that he \"took most of the chicken off of the bill\". He charged us a little less than half of the full price, which was still ridiculous. He should've taken the entire meal off of the bill since serving undercooked chicken is extremely dangerous.

Very impressed and loved the outdoor seating. Bolongese pasta was my favorite. Pizza and apps were always great as well. Never had an issue with service.\n\nBrought family this evening and did not have such a great experience. First off, bolongese pasta is off the menu. I asked the man who I couldn't figure out was a waiter or manager or what, as he kept coming over to the table as well as our waiter, why it was gone. I was told the new meatball dish was an \"evolution\" of the bolongese. Really? They also increased the price significantly from the bolongese. Skeptically, I order it. We also ordered other pizza, pasta and an app. \n\nWell, app is fine and the pizza that came out way before the pastas was ok. Bit too much topping. We strike out in two of three pastas when they arrive. One winner was the shrimp, the other two were red based sauces, meatball and scuie scuie. Both had no flavor. Meatballs were good but the sauce was just plain bland. My wife sent hers back and got a pizza instead which came out soggy. Waiter took it off the bill. My wife basically left hungry. Come to find out, the cook is new. Which explains the menu change. Evidently the bolongese removal was not popular with the waitstaff either. \n\nExperience kind of ruined the evening as it was supposed to be a nice family night out. The man that was not the waiter that took our comments tried to tell us the pizza was supposed to be floppy. Really could have done without with his attitude. It costs too much to eat out to have this type of experience. The place was not very crowded which was unusual given how busy it was during the summer.

When the owner is there, we find the food tasty and fresh. When he's not there... hmmm.\n\nThe other night may have been one of those nights. I had a lot of trouble placing my order over the cell phone (for pick up): a double char combo, single char combo, plus kid's meal bean/cheese burrito combo. No problem with the first two items, but we wanted to substitute the Mexican rice for the fries on the kid's meal. We do this all the time. Communicating that change to the order-taker was challenging, but we finally seemed to get on the same page after agreeing to pay an extra 50 cents for the substitution. I don't know whether we've paid that surcharge in the past, but whatever -- the kid wants rice.\n\nIt was a busy in the restaurant but we finally got the food into the car to take home. We found no side of Mexican rice in the order even though we paid the extra .50. Glad we checked before driving off. Had to go back in to the restaurant to get the rice, which took another 10+ minutes, during which time numerous patrons were coming to the front to ask where their missing food items were. By the time we got home, things were lukewarm at best. But the rice, we discovered, had been put into the burrito. If you know kids, you know that SEPARATE foods are important to them, so this wasn't appreciated by my son, but he made a comment and ate half of it anyway. Okay, miscommunication can happen, not a big deal.\n\nBut what's not acceptable? The double burger was tasty and fresh as normal. The single burger was on a stale crusty bun, the meat patty dry, overcooked, and had only the slightest trace of the cheese that I'd requested, and had no lettuce and tomato. It was so disappointing, and in stark contrast to the double burger's goodness. Do they pre-make some of these single burgers and let them sit around a while??? Because that sure is what it seemed to be -- a premade, dry, stale single burger. \n\nPlease, Cal Taco -- I recommend your restaurant to friends regularly, but I'm going to have to stop if you are premaking burgers.

We had a group of 8 here for a birthday and overall, we enjoyed our experience but that is certainly more because of the people.   The food I found was pretty good on my initial visit here starting off with salmon dumplings and pot stickers, everyone enjoyed them.  The rolls we all ordered were all eaten to the last piece and I had the most interesting one, the Baked Manchester roll.  It comes out looking like a baked potato so it took me awhile to figure out there actually was a cut up roll underneath the toppings.  This was a pretty good dish.  \n\nWhere they really failed was the service, not very good at all.  Apps came out without any napkins or chopsticks and it took a few minutes to get those.   Two salads and extra water requested never came and dirty dishes sat there, even given several chances to clear them and even after business had settled down.  They were still on the table when we left and we were in a spot in the lounge the waiter had to constantly go by.  Also, I ended up sitting right under the TV so of course that was very annoying, but not only to me, and mixed with the dance music overhead, uggh.  Why is it that every Asian restaurant has to have a TV in it and this one ruined what could have been a pretty nice lounge experience.  \n\nMight I try this place again?  Probably not unless someone really wants to go.", "date": "2013-02-23 18:54:59"}

Our company flew us out to Nashville for a FY15 Sales Kickoff Conference. I had a room here for 3 nights.\n\nCheck in was interesting....They had 3 people checking in about 80 new arrivals. Luckily for me, I was only 10 people deep and so my wait was pretty decent. Something like that wont ruin my impression of this place.\n\nGaylord Opryland is a beautiful resort. I spent most of my time in the atrium, listening to the waterfalls and looking at all the palm trees, architecture, koi in the river, etc...\n\nI understand why many people bitch about the layout and how far it is going from one section to the other, however.....have you ever been to Vegas?? If so, this place is a cake walk. I'm pretty sure if this was small, and compact...it wouldn't be a convention center.\n\nMy room was just fine for what it was. It felt a little dated, but it had every amenity that I needed. The bathroom had a spacious shower, and enough counter space for me to lay out toiletries for my stay. \n\nHouse keeping did a great job of cleaning my room daily. Lots of hotels have a habit of picking up all your personal stuff and either puting it in piles, or moving it around enough that it leaves you with a really insecure feeling.  What I appreciated was that they simply straightened out my stuff and left it where it was.\n\nThey have many places to eat and drink here.  I didn't eat at any of the restaurants that were housed within Gaylord, so I can't speak to that. I would suggest taking a cab downtown and hitting up some good ol' Tennessee BBQ. Cab's from Gaylord to downtown are $25 and $1 per head after that. So make sure you plan for that one.\n\nService was great all around. Even when having breakfast and lunch in the convention area, I was impressed with the food they brought out. It was no culinary master piece, but it was a hell of a lot better than i've had in the past at Ceasar's Palace in Vegas. \n\nWould I spend my own $$ at this place?? Ehhhhh, I dont know....I think I would look for a hotel that's more centrally located. However as far as business is concerned, I think it's great for business meetings, conferences, and events.", "date": "2014-07-30 19:25:12"}

The ambience is reminiscent of a classic New Orleans restaurant; low lighting, crowded dining room, and a stacked bar. Although we waited an hour for a table, the hosts and hostesses were extremely accommodating and gave recommendations to nearby restaurants to those who didn't wish to wait. The service is great and extremely attentive, but since the crowd demands the service, it can be tough to get your specific waiter if you need anything. As for the food, the barbecue shrimp is definitely worth the hype. It's messy, but the sauce is so damn luxurious and the shrimp is local. The waiter gave me a bib to wear and a hot towel with lemon after the meal. \nI didn't get a chance to try the bread pudding, but I will definitely look forward to dining here again if I find myself in New Orleans in the future.", "date": "2017-03-16 19:59:07"}

So were were both miserable when we came in (bless you air conditioning). The restaurant is split up into cold items and lunch foods and warmer meals and coffee on the other side. Of course for brunch the coffee/hot food was the busiest and had a long line (though nothing compared to Biscuit Love). It took us around 10 minutes to get through the line and order our food, which I consider pretty amazing for peak brunch time on Sunday without a reservation. I ordered the avocado toast with one fried egg and my BF had the fried chicken biscuit with gravy. We each had coffee and lucky for me they had just started serving frose (rose with watermelon puree and vermouth). It was delicious, refreshing, and not sweet at all which is how I like my rose. The coffee was strong and delicious and came out pretty quickly after ordering it. The drinks were really on point. Our entrees came out on paper plates and we had to use plastic silverware. This was really confusing. The ambiance is sleek and upscale, so this was quite a bit of a turn off and left something to be desired. It's also difficult to eat a messy fried chicken biscuit with gravy using a flimsy knife and fork. Also my avocado toast looked slopped on the plate. I thought that was again weird for a nice establishment. Especially when the total cost with tip was $32.00 (I did get alcohol but still). \nHowever, what the food lacked in visual appeal more than made up for in taste. Both dishes were very good. I would leave the egg off the toast next time, but it was still fresh and tasty. We sampled the jalapeno grits which sounded amazing but were pretty forgettable. \nWe had a nice experience here overall, and I really want to come back and check out their cheese plates and wine in the evening.", "date": "2017-08-08 02:28:41"}

We ordered the gyros (lunch sandwich for me, omelette for my boyfriend). Lunch came with homemade potato chips for the sandwich, and field greens for the omelette. One could substitute an Eleniki salad for chips, and that is what I did.\n\nThe salad was fine. The portion was perfect. Sadly, they served it in a tiny bowl that made eating it a bit difficult. When I first put my fork in the bowl, ingredients started spilling out. Then, and this is a nit, they gave me a stem of peperoncini. This would have been okay if all the branches on the stem had a pepper. It just look weird -- and sort of like someone was eating peppers off that branch and gave me what they didn't want. Really, it would have been better for the chef to have removed the one pepper that remained and just put that on my plate.\n\nThe gyros sandwich (their most popular item) was just not interesting. It didn't taste bad, but it lacked flavor and dimension.\n\nIt needed more tomatoes (sliced, not wedges) and red onion slices (instead of big chunks of white onion). The tzatziki was fine, but the lamb was not terribly flavorful. I would also grill the pita just a bit before assembling.\n\nAll in all, Momo's was a cute little cafe with so-so food.

But not my first choice. \n\nOn a positive note:\nA friend and I decided to share a \"barbecue beef\" sandwich and a half order of rib tips, and it was enough to feed us then- and then we had left overs for later. I definitely got the \"bang for my buck\" feeling. We didn't spend over $25 combined. I would definitely only take-out in the place, definitely. \n\nHowever, (yes, however) the meat was tough. Like really friggin tough. Which is never a great adjective for barbecue. Ever. \nIt was so tough it gave me empathy for any senior citizen that's ever been challenged by any sort of food experience. \nI almost choked three times from trying to force my throat to swallow the meat just because my jaws were exhausted from chewing.\nWhich kind of inadvertently canceled out the fact that we got the generous portions. Perhaps, pessimistically it could lead one to think they were attempting to get rid of the last servings of the jerky, I mean barbecue... Which would explain why we had enough food for four.\n \nThe sauce was greasy to say the least and it looked  loose like Carolina style sauce, but definitely tasted of sugar and water, I wouldn't expect them to be bottling it anytime soon. \n \nMoving on, the \"barbecue beef\" sandwich was NOT, I repeat, not brisket. Which was kind of confusing because it is a BBQ joint- brisket is a staple in 99% of them ( so welcome to that 1 percentile King's Ribs). It kind of figures though , because the menu was vague to say the least. \nBut imagine my foodie horror as I unveiled this box beef that had the consistency of pot roast but with that disappointing Crock Pot taste. Eeek! not my favorite by far. Plus they put zero sauce on it, so either way it would have been a lose-lose situation. Needless to say, it was wasted. \n\nI mean don't get me wrong it wasn't all bad. The rib tips that weren't drenched in that water sauce or that I didn't almost asphyxiate on we're in fact delicious, moist and tender. I counted about 5 tips out of possibly 25  that didn't fail us that day. \n\nI've eaten King's Rib since I was a kid. And honestly it's like Russian Roulette. You may get a good day with tender cuts of ribs and tips and pulled pork... But other days you get huge mouthfuls of pure greasy sugar soaked leather, that make you die a little inside. \nI just want to not choke, or break my jaw to get sustenance. Is that too much for a foodie girl to ask? \n\nLong story short. You need food on a lunch break, in-between meetings or commutes? Try it out, you'll be nourished and won't be served anything inedible. \n\nBut I like to eat, food that is not based in mediocrity so I just couldn't really fathom being a regular there. \nSo try it, I'm all for local businesses. \nJust don't bring your grandma or anyone over 65 if their teeth aren't what they used to be. But please whatever you do- do not order the barbecue beef. \n\n-dev", "date": "2015-07-06 00:33:24"}

My brothers and I showed up to ensure that everything was set up, wine/beers were prepared, and our family members were greeted and parked discreetly. First, my brother and I had to scramble to find a marker and cross off the tacky price-per-person listed on the bottom of each pre-fixe menu (yes it was $50 a head but no you don't need know that is what we are paying for you to celebrate my dad's birthday). My 3 little nieces and nephews who can't drink and my grandpop who doesn't drink were not offered sodas/juices which was weird to me - what 10 year old just wants water? \n\nThe menu said we would receive an antipasta plate with artichokes, and asparagus. No artichokes, no asparagus. Salad course was a fine option - fruit/nut salad, Caesar, some other fruit/nut combo salad (garden or Italian salad with gorgonzola lovers, look elsewhere). For dinner, I chose the salmon & crab scampi. The salmon was very good but the crab scampi/pasta was swimming in oil. And not the good garlicky-buttery-oily sauce that we know and love with our scampi...just EVOO - drippy and...just not good. Lastly, the anticipated dessert course. I was going to have a custom made Phillies shirt cake for my Dad for his birthday but the menu listed the family style dessert as, \"Family Style dessert sampler featuring our homemade cakes, bread puddings, cannolies and other specialty desserts.\" so I though another cake would be way too much. Boy was I wrong. 3 \"samplers\" came out on regularly sized entree plates with 1 small slice (not a huge chunk I was expecting from back in the Viggiano's days) of chocolate cake, 1 very watery cannoli, and 3 cookies. Yes. Cookies. For adults. Not biscotti. Chocolate chip or sugar cookies. My 11 year old nephew was ecstatic - the rest of us? Underwhelmed and unsatisfied. \n\nI am wondering if Trattoria is too small to handle a large party (17 of us total) at one time - maybe going in small groups is the better way to go. Our servers were phenomenal and the chef poked his head out of the kitchen to say hello a few times and he was a genuinely nice man, but I can say I will not be bringing anyone back to Trattoria for a large group.

A guy from high school(11 yrs ago) showed up with 2 of his friends and sat down with our table. We had a group of 5 plus the guys who sat with us. The guys from hs left and then one by one the people that I came with closed their labs and left. The birthday day girl and I were the last 2 left we asked for our tabs payed them and tipped our waitress well(over 20%) even though she wasn't very good but we have all been servers before so we are good tippers. The waitress then told us that one of the guys sitting with us did not pay his tab ($31) we apologized and said sorry and explained to her that he had mentioned  something about coming back up here. She was rude,  I told her I was trying to get his # and let him know he still owed money. I called him and texted him= no response. The manager then came over and said that if we didn't get him back up here to pay or if we didn't pay that they were calling the cops on us. I said sorry this has happened but we are not responsible for him. We already paid for our food and drinks. We go to leave and they barricaded the door and would not let us leave. They then called the Berry Hill Police Dept on us. They treated us like criminals. It was awful I felt they bullied us and tried to use scary tactics to try and force us to pay for a tab that wasn't ours. The police did not take our name or charge us for anything bc we obviously had not done nothing wrong. The whole ordeal was infuriating and humiliating. The guy finally came back and paid for his tab.\n The next day I called to talk with the general manager and he informed me that  their \"policy\" is if you sit at table with a group of people that you the customer are responsible to make sure everyone had paid for their tab.?!?!?\nI've been to plenty of bars and I've never in my life heard of such a bullshit policy. I've spoke to lawyers and metro police offices and they all agree it was complete bullshit. That is a horrible way to run a business.

I would absolutely recommend this supermarket for the everyday sort of items or those you typically stock up on - canned goods, toiletries, paper items, household cleaners, dry goods, etc. There are amazing deals all the time on the things we use/consume the most often. The place is relatively clean, although once, someone snuck their little rat dog in and it pooped in a shopping cart/onto the floor in the frozen section and it was not cleaned up right away at all - AND they left the cart (w/ poop and all) right there for everyone to walk by and gag.\n\nIf it's produce you're trying to buy, Iovine's in the Reading Terminal Market is even cheaper for 100x better quality products. However, the produce isn't horrid here either. I WOULD NEVER BUY SEAFOOD OR MEAT here - items like Purdue chicken/turkey where you KNOW the items have been packaged securely and cannot be reopened are OK. The deli counter is the slowest this side of the Mason-Dixon and I have encountered several employees who have mis-priced cold cuts (make sure you check their work). I even had one experience where the guy yelled AT ME for not telling him it was on sale... he specifically said \"How am I suppose to know what's on sale all the time?\"... ummmmm... yeah. So, customer service is definitely not enforced in the store - not to say that every employee is a jerk. \n\nSometimes, items marked on sale in the circular aren't marked on sale on the shelf - I usually forgo the items especially on large trips when I often forget to make sure the prices come up correctly at the register. NEVER GO ON THURSDAYS - the aisles are a mess w/ new products and price stickers go missing b/c new sales start on Fridays. By Sunday, most items on sale have not been restocked from the weekend masses either. \n\nIf you are bringing your own bag(s), don't use the self check out lines... the scales are retarded and the employees aren't usually the most observant or even locatable when you need assistance. \n\nIf you ride a bike, like me, and typically can only buy what you can carry on your back, there is a bike rack and other poles and such available to lock up to - never had a problem with that.", "date": "2011-02-24 20:27:06"}

The General Jackson showboat is docked along the Cumberland river, which runs right next to the hotel grounds. The conference I was here for hosted an evening dinner cruise on the General Jackson, and the experience was phenomenal. \n\nFor those that want to get to downtown Nashville from the Opryland Hotel, they offer a shuttle for a cost.

As you can tell from a quick glance at my Yelp page, I have eaten at our fair share of nice places. Mr. B's seriously failed on many levels. I'll explain:\n\n1) We were originally seated at what we like to call an \"afterthought table\". It was out in the walkway between the main dining area and the bar and had people constantly walking past it and bumping into the chairs. It also had what was basically a spotlight over it, which for an otherwise dimly lit restaurant, made us feel like we were awkwardly on display. At these prices, this table shouldn't exist, and sadly, there are two of them. \n\n2) After getting seated we waited an eternity for our waiter to come back by and take our drink orders. When he finally showed after about 15-20 min, we brought up the lighting issue and asked if the light could be dimmed. He said no. The manager offered us a new table and we accepted.\n\n3)Upon being seated at the new table with a new wait staff member, we were given a wine list and told the specials. Neither of these things happened at the first table, which made u question what was going on with the disjointed service.\n\n4) After this, the good service stopped. Our waitress was all but non- existent.\n\n5) She messed up our drink order which was a a simple two glasses of wine (the same wine at that).\n\n6) The food was abysmal. I ordered the barbecued shrimp and after peeling, it was poop tracks galore. Who wants to remove feces from their dinner before eating it? I only got through three shrimp on a $30 meal which is a shame. A peeled shrimp option of this dish would be great for those who don't want to deal with peeling and deveining at the table themselves.\n\n7) The waitress saw how little I ate and didn't ask about it or offer to make it right.\n\n8) After we paid our bill, she came and picked up the merchant copy off the table about 30 seconds after it was signed, right in front of us,and opened it in front of us to check the tip she had received. In this level of restaurant, that behavior was disgusting. You are never supposed to pick up the check from the table while the patrons are still sitting there. The check was picked up, while the dirty dishes still sat in front of us.\n\nNever again, Mr. B's! There are far better options for the money in NOLA!", "date": "2016-05-10 03:36:16"}

A 10 oz filet wrapped in bacon runs you $27 here and it's always a perfectly cooked and seasoned buttery piece of prime filet resting on a sizzling plate of garlic butter sauce. Anywhere else that 10 oz filet would run you much higher and I've done the meticulous menu research to prove it. \n\nIf you can get it, ask for one of their intimate booths where thick carpet curtains close you into an old world dining environment. There is something mildly erotic to me about the whole idea of sipping on martinis inside a carpet cloaked, virtually sound proof booth while catering to your primal meat cravings. The servers were super nice and curteous without being overly attentive. As our server told us, \"If there is nothing else I can get you, enjoy your meal and just open the curtain when you are ready.\" I thought that was marvelous. I like good service but I hate feeling suffocated while I'm trying to relax over good food so I appreciated their laid back curtain policy. It makes you feel like there is no rush in the world and your allowed to stay for as long as you like.\n\nWe tried their wilted spinach and mushroom sides, which were good but nothing memorable. Next time I'll definitely try the Au Gratin instead but I was avoiding any heavy sides so I could focus all my energy on my filet and saving room for dessert. \n\nSpeaking of dessert, we got their Z Pie, which was exceptionally better than I thought it would be. The menu description certainly does not do it justice! I was completely full by dessert but vowed I would struggle to split a bite with my friend and ended up fighting with them over it down to the last bite. That is a pretty rare occurrence for me since I'm never much of a huge dessert person. \n\nI had been to this restaurant once before but wanted to take a new friend there who I knew would appreciate a good steak dinner and has the same picky taste for a rare \"pittsburgh style\" prepared steak as I. They were also very impressed with the quality of the steak for the price and loved that the place was a \"casual steakhouse\" atmosphere. You don't need to feel underdressed or out of place if your not in the mood to fuss over getting too dressy, but still want a quality dinner. I'm not sure if this area gets a little dicey at night or not but I did appreciate the nice security guard who mostly just hangs out outside and opens the doors for guests. \n\nI would suggest anyone who is on the fence about trying this place to definitely give it a go! I would be completely shocked if anyone who went here ever had a disappointing experience. I love a prime quality steak, but hate over priced and pretentious chain steakhouse restaurants so this place hits the mark 100% for me.", "date": "2014-12-21 05:41:44"}

Right when we walked in we were enveloped in the amazing aroma of the food.  I was expecting a decent crowd, but to my surprise it was pretty dead.  SCORE!  The fewer humans I have to share a buffet with, the better. (As we were leaving like 15 people walked in)\n\nThere were 3 meat dishes (tandoori chicken, boneless chicken curry, beef meatballs) and 4 veggie dishes (chickpeas, potato&cauliflower, and some others) along with pakoras (cauliflower fritters), salad, naan, rice pudding, and various chutneys.  I was surprised to see the beef dish, as beef is not common in Indian cuisine.  The only bummer -- no paneer (cheese cubes)!  I'm pretty sure the buffet choices change day-to-day.\n\nAll the food was really great.  The food was spicier than I thought it would be, so be forewarned.  The salad was fresh.  Try some of that bright green mint chutney with your pakoras, but watch out for the heat!  And the rice pudding was the perfect way to end the meal.\n\nGreat service, great atmosphere.

I so wanted to like BU, to support a local chain, to enjoy the quirky environs, and the moderately inventive offerings, but I think I'm finally done.  Last night was probably the last visit to BU we'll make for a while.  My boyz and I all left a little queasy after the greasy fried mushrooms and onion rings.  We were hungry; they tasted good while they were hot, but we all acknowledged while we were eating them they were overly greasy and oily.  BU has never really gotten the fried part right and last night was the final straw for us.  The fried food seems to always be soaked in oil.  Last night, it was overwhelming and just too heavy for us all.  We're not wilting lillys when it comes to meat and fat, but even for us, it was a bit much and the the oil smelled a bit old.\n\nService is always spotty, which tells me there isn't consistent training and it was spotty last night.  I ordered a turkey patty with my wedge and was given a full blown turkey sandwich; not even sure I was charged for it; I was tired and didn't want to even pursue it.  What-ever.  Our server was nice and had a great attitude, but he left us sitting for a long time and then the food runners didn't know who had ordered what. \n\nMessage for BU Wait Staff:  It's pretty darned simple to take 5 seconds before you get to the table to figure out who ordered what.  I've waited tables before and have been helped by my fellow wait staff; we got organized ahead of arriving at the table.  I also didn't force my customers to scramble to reorganize the table settings while I stood waiting laden down with hot food.  Don't make your customers do that.  That move really gets up my nose.  You can prepare for that--your customers want to relax; don't stress them out trying to help you b/c you were ill prepared to deliver the food.\n\nSo, the good part:\nThe food isn't bad, but it's inconsistent.  Last night, my husband and boys had great burgers on gluten free buns.  They were perfectly cooked mid-rare. The buns were tasty and not dry at all.  \n\nBut, that won't be enough to bring us back.  We need a break from BU to let us forget the mixed results, the queasy feeling in our stomachs from too much grease, and the sense that I'm overpaying for amateurish staff.\n\nBU's homemade ketchup is very tasty.  So is the dipping sauce for the fries as well as the mustard aioli, which I use on my salad -- it's like honey mustard.  The fries are always soggy and are served in a stainless steel cup, which just makes them even more soggy. \n\nSigh.  Goodbye for a while, BU.", "date": "2014-08-14 01:31:14"}

I've been to a few Peruvian restaurants and I must say this one tops them all as far as style. The environment is classy, decorated with hundreds of wine bottles and art. It definitely makes you want to stay and chat with your friends. Or consume your food slowly so you can enjoy the scenery. Their portions are smaller than other Peruvian restaurants, but the flavor in their food is good. I ordered Ceviche Mixto and it came out great.

What I really like about this place is the decor, which brings me closer to Korea and ancient time. The decoration is simple and classic. The place feels cool inside in term of temperature because it is build slightly below the ground level. And the food is perfect for winter time, because it will make you sweat!\n\nThe food is amazing here if you order their soft tofu. It comes with the tofu soup, rice and side dishes, which are amazing. (Don't be shy to ask for more if you want more kimchi, cucumber or bean spout).  I've tried pretty much all the different soft tofu on the menu. I recommend ordering soft tofu and nothing else, because on the flip side menu, there is not much to order. The food is just ok and quite pricey. If I have to recommend, I would say the bibimbap in hot stone pot.  Everything else is not really worth it, although I have friends who really dig the BBQ squid. Also if you order soft tofu, the spiciness is important, you have to at least go number 2 in term of spiciness or the soft tofu won't taste as good. One of my favorite is the mushroom soft tofu.", "date": "2013-05-31 06:30:19"}

We were told wait would be 15-25 minutes for 3, at around 7:45 on a Tuesday night. Not bad, but we decided to sit at the bar cause we were starving. \n\nBartender was a little distant at first, but seemed to be the same with the others at the bar as well so we didn't take it personally. Ended up warming up to us really nicely though. Chatted with some servers as they came to the bar to deliver food and they were all incredibly friendly. Complementary loaf of the lightest, fluffiest French bread. \n\nI got the Seared Jumbo Scallops appetizer: $15. Came with a small salad. The scallops were delicious! Flavorful, tender, and cooked to perfection. Practically melted in the mouth. The order came with only 2, but they were huge as promised, and it was only an appetizer after all. \n\nI decided I needed a little something more, and went with the Soup 1-1-1: $8.50; a combo of their three soups-Gumbo Ya Ya (good, nothing extraordinary, had a little kick; the sausage didn't have too much flavor), Seafood Gumbo (similar to the Gumbo Ya Ya; same kick, both had wild rice in it) and the Soup Du Jour (not exactly sure what it was; yellow-golden color, rich, creamy flavor with shrimp). The Du Jour was the best of the 3, but the trio option was still nice. This came with a loaf of French bread as well. \n\nBistro Salad: $9. The vinaigrette was delightful, but the veggies weren't anything special. \n\nSoft Shell Crab: $34. Delicious!! Looks deceptively brown and shriveled, but almost squirted juices as it was cut. Crab meat was soft; could've been less lightly breaded. The corn bed was perfect; creamy and flavorful, and went nicely with the loaf of French bread. \n\nTwo beers+tip brought the tab to $100.", "date": "2016-06-15 02:33:34"}

I have very fond memories of meals here at Mr. B's so I knew we had to eat at Mr. B's at least once during out visit.  I'm always happy to share a meal here because everything I order here is always delicious and so enjoyable. It was the first time for my husband but I've got him hooked. \n\nWe ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp with red-eye gravy and grits.  Mike loves grits done the \nthe old fashion southern way like how his great Aunt made it.  The grits here were rich smooth creamy and satisfying.  But the shrimps with bacon with the red eye sauce is what shined.  I practically licked the plate.  We also ordered gumbo ya ya and crab cake on a bed of Maque Choux.  I could'nt finish everything but the maque choux was so delicious I had to scoop up the remainder to go so I could enjoy later.\n\nFor dessert we enjoyed the mixed berry cobbler. It was a very memorable meal.\n\nI was here with my sister and her family 3 years ago for Thanksgiving and although we all did not order the traditional Thanksgiving meal, we all shared the different dishes and were completely happy with what we had.", "date": "2017-05-02 19:14:58"}

There's tons of kale and quinoa for the \"food snob\" in you, but they also have a good peanut butter & jelly sandwich (with apples!). The menu varies pretty regularly, with new quiches and roasted veggies every few days. \n\nI primarily come here for the soup, about which I am generally quite picky. It's always homemade and you can get an advance preview of the week's soups on their website. They even take customer suggestions sometimes. The split pea is always a big winner, it has fresh baked ham in it rather than those creepy cube things. \n\nThe staff here is great; they are generally very friendly. They can sometimes get a little harried around the lunch rush, and you might have to wait a little. If you're impatient, I suggest you call ahead. They're a family business and love to chat it up if they know you. \n\nThe only negative part about the Apron experience is possibly the prices-I've known multiple people to complain about how much stuff here costs. I tend to think paying for high-quality tastes-like-homemade food is worth it, so YMMV.\n\nReal talk: I would not be going to this place 3 times a week if I didn't think they were freaking amazing.

I ordered a long island ... two of them actually ... and they both tasted good ... but didn't have that \"i'm filled with alcohol\" taste i'm used to and instead tasted like lemonade. Maybe they used top shelf ingredients that made it smooth, or maybe they just used a lot of mixer (but my guess is the latter). Either way, two of them didn't set me in my place. So, they were a bit weak. \n\nMy first experience of Brew Brothers was the one at the Airport, and the long islands there were A LOT better then the ones I had at the El Dorado, but the airport isn't a friday night hangout.\n\nWould I come back?

He put their food orders in right away, before we even had a chance to request it. He brought them the coloring menus promptly, and when he realized they were out of crayons, he gave one of the kids his own pen.

Unfortunately, the level and quality of service and food have slowly dragged it from a solid 4-5 stars to a 2 in my opinion.  They have a free birthday dinner for you on your special day with a Florida Drivers license, and always 2-4-1 drinks. That being said, the bartender pours like a miser, and the food is way more expensive for anyone else in your party. The hostess WILL NOT seat you until all members of your party are there. Good luck on everyone being there on time and parked too -- the lot is way to small to support the business.  Chefs can be hit or miss on performance.

I really would.  The grounds are nothing short of spectacular, the service staff is wonderful, helpful, polite with typical Southern hospitality.  The rooms are clean, comfortable, and have all the feel of the luxury you crave.  They run shuttles both to the airport and to the Grand Ole Opry.  It's within walking distance of the Opry Mills mall.  The food was lovely at the Cascades restaurant and fairly tasty at the Jack Daniels bar.  You can find pretty much everything you want to buy at their myriad stores both on Delta Island and around the complex.  The Attractions Desk is very convenient to buy tickets to any nearby place.  To be honest, I've never stayed at a better place in my entire travel life.  Yes, it is admittedly slightly difficult to find your way around, but the maps and signs scattered about are very helpful and the people are always willing to happily give you directions to any place you want to get to.  And for a place this size, and this artistic, such directional confusion can't be helped.\n\nOk, so why can't I give it five stars?  Because of their billing practices and the fact that all their \"hidden fees\" add up.  First, they advertise a $15 \"resort fee\" per day.  Now technically you don't HAVE to pay this, but if you choose not to, you can't take any of their event shuttles and you won't have any internet access from your room, and in my book, those things are pretty major when you're on vacation.  Oh, and they don't tell you that the \"resort fee\" is taxed, so it really is almost $17 per day.\n\nSecond, they add \"city tax\" to every meal charged.  Now I'm sure this is old hat to residents, but for a place obviously built for tourists and out-of-towners, this should be disclosed upon checkin.  It is not....or if it is, it's in such fine print that it's easy to miss.  So my $48 meal (which included a generous $10 tip for the admittedly excellent service I received) was really over $50.\n\nOh, and one cannot forget the tax on the hotel price, which is nearly $20 per day even at the convention rate for which I stayed.  An experienced traveler, of course, allows for this, but it's something you must take into account when you budget.\n\nAt the end of my three-day midweek stay, here's how all the \"hidden fees\" added up:\n\nHotel room tax:  $19.67 * 3 = 59.01\nResort fee:  $15/day * 3 = 45.00\nResort fee tax: $1.39/dat * 3 = 4.17\nCity tax on meals: $2.50 per meal, $7.50/day for 3 meals a day = 22.50\n\nSo for total...I paid $130.68 solely in taxes and fees for my stay!!!  Now I think that's pretty significant, and if one stayed a week figure it would be twice that much.\n\nSo while the place itself couldn't be better, I believe the hotel really should be more honest as to what it really costs to stay there.\n\nAnd incidentally, if you plan on getting here by car, be sure to allow ANOTHER $18 per day to park it here.  I'm not sure if the parking fee is taxed or not, since I didn't get here that way, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was.  Truly insane.", "date": "2009-08-10 16:46:27"}

If you stay there in the hotel they must have good services but to visit you can just eat or shop or wander.  Very expensive restaurants, ersatz something of one type or another, so I chose to eat at Jack's BBQ downtown, a real place in a real city.  I shopped elsewhere at a fifth the price.  And I wandered Nashville, seeing real people of all types, not just upscale tourists wandering a hotel.  When I left Opryland complex, since I was not staying at their hotel, I had to pay a HEFTY parking fee, much more than I've ever paid for a full day of parking in New York's Broadway area.

Between the three of us, we ordered three drinks.  Two were beers, which is hard to mess up.  The last was supposed to have been a cherry vodka with sprite.  We instead got regular vodka with sometime resembling sprite (with about as much carbonation as a glass of water) and grenadine.  Needless to say, it didn't taste great.  I then ordered the saganaki.  The less than enthusiastic male who brought it out seemed to have added too much oil or something.  It proceeded to continue sizzling and shooting oil all over our table after he put it down.  The bottom was charred and stuck to the pan before it was even cool enough for us to take a bite.  We decided that we were going to cut our losses and head across the street to Fortel's.

My wife had a pair of fish taco's.  My son had the double cheesburger with bacon he usually has plus an order of fries.\n\nWandering over to the salsa bar I noticed they eliminated the fire roasted salsa.  That is a shame since I really liked it.   My wife went for the regular red salsa and I had the salsa verde.  The food was ready shortly and the first thing I noticed is the portions had increases along with the prices.  The taco's were huge.  The steak tack was dissapointing with the steak being dry and overcooked.  The chick tack was sliced, grilled chicken breast.  It too was a little dry but nothing a splash of salsa verde couldn't fix.  My wife said the fish taco's were fine and my son reported the burgers as \"about the same as before\" which was decent.\n\nSo, in summary, the new management has not changed things much.

There were some tough parts in the crab but mostly it was good, soft meat. We came around 3pm and that seemed to be the perfect time for a short wait. We got a nice outdoor seat overlooking the pier. By around 5pm, when we were done eating, the line was outrageously long and only getting longer. Pretty great deal with a good view. \n\nHusband got the coconut shrimp that came with coleslaw and onion rings and he was really happy that the coconut tasted so real.", "date": "2014-04-21 18:49:16"}

The food is good....really good.  Anything with three sticks of butter in it will taste good, so not much to add to other reviews already raving about the shrimp, oysters, gumbo, etc. \n\nMy issue is with the customer service.  I had the pleasure of having a tray of hot Irish Coffee's spilled on my down jacket.  Anyone who's owned down, knows that cleaning is a pain, especially when it's a hot, dairy based alcoholic drink.  \n\nAfter the incident, the manager of the night, Larry came over and told me to have the jacket dry cleaned and to send Mr.B's the bill.  Everything will be taken care of, he said.  No comp, no help, and the waiter acted apprehensive for the rest of the night.   So, it was my responsibility to find a place to dry clean my jacket, send them the bill and rely on their good word to reimburse me at their convenience.  I took the high road and tipped them 15%.\n\nI tried the next morning to get the jacket dry cleaned but I was told it would take more than a day since cleaning down is a chore.  I returned to Mr.B's and spoke to another manager, Randy (i think), who treated me like I was trying to scam the restaurant after spending over $100 the night before.  I explained the situation and that is was not possible to clean my jacket before returning home (CA).  He treated me like crap, so I sent my wife in after him.  \n\nShe somehow managed to convince Randy that this was not our fault and that we should be reimbursed the $75 we were quoted at the dry cleaners.  He told her he would call me within a half-hour.  I received a phone call with Randy on the line telling me he would reimburse me $50 and after I go through the b.s. of cleaning the jacket, sending the receipt and waiting for their response, they would reimburse me the difference.  I was furious.  \n\nMy wife called him back and as it stands now, we are waiting for Mr.B's to reimburse us the $75 for the dry cleaning and we have a month to send them a receipt.  I'll update the review if we actually receive the $75.\n\nAs a business owner, I know when you spill a tray of hot alcoholic drinks on a customer, it's not their fault, nor their responsibility to rectify the situation.  It's also unprofessional, petty and un-American.  \n\nThe food is good, just watch out for accidents and if something goes wrong at dinner, raise hell and have it rectified immediately.  Pathetic.", "date": "2013-12-31 23:39:18"}

It's an older restaurant and the front makes the cafe look a lot smaller than it really is.  Don't let that deter you from coming inside.  This place is excellent!\n\nThe service is always good.  Most of the staff have been working here for many years.  They are happy with their jobs and it shows in the pride they take in their attitudes and their service.  Sunday mornings are usually very busy.  There will be a wait most of the time.  They have a couple of benches inside on which people can sit, but you'll find people standing in the front of the bar, standing in the breeze way, or sitting on the benches in front of the restaurant.  \n\nBe forewarned, on busy days, when they take your name, they will ask if everyone in your party is there.  They will not call your name until everyone is there because they want to make certain the tables are turned over as efficiently as possible.  A place this popular needs to do this to keep the customers happy.\n\nOn busy mornings, if you have to wait for your table, you don't have to wait for your morning cupa.  They will have coffee, cups, sugar, and cream so you can drink your coffee while waiting for a table.  They will also have water available if you're not a coffee drinker.\n\nThe menu is split between breakfast and lunch as they close for the day in the late afternoon.  No matter what you order, you'll not leave hungry.  The prices are very reasonable and you'll get a lot.  They don't mind special orders and customize anything.  \n\nThe waffles you can take as an option on the side are crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  They are served with a generous dollop of whipped margarine and a small container of syrup.  If you want more syrup, just ask.\n\nMy husband has been a real fan of the Eggs Benedict that will often appear as a special.  The eggs are always done well, the hash browns are done very well and are not at all greasy.  \n\nThe breakfast burritos are so big, you'll want to save half for another meal.\n\nI've only had lunch a couple of times but will indulge in the potato sticks with real fry sauce.\n\nIf you don't want to go inside, they have a drive-up window.\n\nWe've never been disappointed and will continue to make this a regular stop.", "date": "2016-02-13 06:58:23"}

Until this place. For real. I am now converted to the church of Korean flavors. Here's the story.\n\nSo I'm feeling terrible one night, really really terrible. I've got a stuffed up nose, I'm super hungry, I'm bloated and its that girly time of the month. And the only thing I want in the whole wide world is just a nice big bowl of warm spicy soup. So I go onto Yelp, and I check out my bookmarks for saved places in my hood. I speed-read a few reviews for this place and convince my husband we need to go here ASAP. \n\nAnd like Audrey Horne, I get what I want.\n\nI ordered the mushroom soft tofu (beo seot soon du bu) and my husband ordered spicy chicken & vegetable (dak gal bi). Both medium spice and both so freaking amazing. My soup is spicy, it's comforting, its downright perfect. It was exactly what I was looking for.\n\nBut before your food is ready, they bring out 5 different banchan: Kimchi, marinated bean sprouts, spicy cucumber slices, adzuki beans, burdock and jalapenos (I think) marinated in sesame oil and soy sauce? Not sure, but they were all tasty. But the best part is they bring you some weirdly awesome hot tea that I can't get enough of. I haven't figured out if it's Boricha (barley tea) or Hyeonmicha (rice tea). So weird and soooo good.\n\nPreventing a few faux pas:\n1) That egg they give you is raw, and it's meant to go in your soup.\n2) The weird little box attached to your table? That's a call button for the staff.\n3) Don't be dumb. That soup is boiling in there, so DON'T touch the caldron-bowl. Use the plate underneath.\n4) Do you mix some of the pitcher of tea with your leftover crispy rice or not? I still haven't figured that one out.\n5) This place is totally not for kids. Delicate wall hangings? Boiling hot stoneware? A call button on the table to play with? A raw egg just sitting there, waiting to be used as a weapon? Yeah.

Here's the deal.  My husband and I went for our anniversary.  When we arrived the host greeted, took our coats, and seated us immediately.  The server was attentive without being overbearing.  The manager (I'm assuming) made a few recommendations and checked on us to make sure his recommendations were satisfying to us.  The staff could not be beat.  \n\nWe ordered ravioli and steakhouse skins for appetizers.  I love that they let you order as many as you want.  We had 1 ravioli and 1 skin for each of us.  Perfect amount.  5 of each would have been way too many.  So if you want to try a few appetizers, you can certainly do so.  Then we each had the Caesar salad.  Excellent.  Homemade dressing that has the perfect tang.  The bread (obviously not made in the restaurant) was also excellent.  \n\nThen came the steaks.  I would have liked a smaller cut of meat because 14 ounce is just too big for me.  But I do not like filet mignon, too thick for my taste.  So I had the 14 ounce strip.  My husband had the bone-in ribeye.  Fantastic.  Great flavor.  Seasoned perfectly so you could still taste the beef.  Carmine's doesn't just add sauce to their steaks to mask the sub-par cuts.  Mine was a little undercooked but the server saw it immediately when I cut into the steak and he took it back to the kitchen.  He offered to have my side dish replaced so it was hot when my steak came out.  I declined because I ate it while I waited for my steak.  Well worth the wait.\n\nMy husband had the twice baked potato and I had the mushroom risotto.  Believe the other reviewers when they say it's the size of a regulation football.  The potato is huge.  It tasted like cheesy bacon goodness.  If the mushroom risotto wasn't fantastic, I would have wanted to switch.  The risotto was top notch.  \n\nThen to the dessert.  I ordered the vanilla caramel cake and my husband ordered the triple chocolate.  They were ok.  Mine tasted like it had been frozen a little too long.  That's the ONLY negative I can say about the entire meal.  I would not order the dessert again.  If you have to bring in frozen desserts, don't offer them at all.  Do your thing and do it well.  If you can't cover all aspects of it flawlessly, then don't do it.  \n\nOur bill was $130 for the two of us.  That includes a few cocktails.  So it is a little on the expensive side but it was worth it.  When we stopped at the coat check to pick up our coats, I saw the valet take off running down the sidewalk.  By the time we had our coat and were walking outside, he had our car pulled up and ready.  The heat was on high, seats were warming, perfect.  Could not have asked for better service.  \n\nThe reviews where people complain about every aspect, they are whiners.  If you can't come up with anything positive about Carmine's, they are whiners that can not be satisfied.", "date": "2013-12-11 12:56:03"}

It overpowered every taste within the gumbo. \n\nThe fillet was ok. Keep in mind this is a $52 dollar dish. Ok doesn't cut it, especially when the best steak in New Orleans, located at Clancy's, is $10 less. \n\nThe bread pudding was also not good. Bread was really chewy and tasted like wet bread.

There is just so much to do here, you will not get bored. Plus it's great for all ages, I saw older folks, as well as many young children. \n\nThe only downfall I would bring up would be the setup of the whole place. It's really easy to get lost. The building is confusing, but there are maps all over the place and people are helping each other all over the place.

From everything I had read or heard about the Opryland resort, I was set on a week of awesome amenities and plenty of relaxation and pampering. However, I was met by fairly unhelpful signage (it will tell you to take elevator \"R1\" to access the pool area from the spa, but not actually how to find the spa), rooms keys that were continuously deactivated (causing many 0.5 mile hikes up and down stairs and over bridges to get to the front desk and back), and amenities that were open...sporadically (I know, I know. The first week in November is probably not peak season. Tell that to my $300/night rate.). It's a great place to visit once, but I don't think I'll be back!\n\nMy husband eloquently described our stay this way: \"it's a beautiful place. Not sure what all the hype is about though.\"\n\nTo give a couple of examples of what I consider to be sub-par service for a place so obviously vying for an upper class clientele:\n-Waiters/Waitresses not saying anything after you are seated, just standing and assuming you will speak first to give a drink order\n-Restaurant staff placing the bread basket in front of just one seat (instead of mid-table) and not describing the contents\n-Sparkling wine, ordered by the bottle, not being chilled at the table and having to refill glasses on our own\n-Having to pay for parking with a credit card, because the room key wouldn't work to allow us out of the self parking lot, and the gate employee coming over to tell us that is what we had to do if our key didn't work (it's not...more inquiries at the front desk led to the discovery that we would have been double-charged for parking that day had we not inquired further)\n-Restaurants being closed with a generic sign asking us to visit another option (without stating what or where those options were)\n-Restaurants and shops closing at 8pm. Acceptable on a weekday. Completely unacceptable for what is sold as an \"inclusive\" resort on a Saturday night.\n\nMaybe my stay was out of the ordinary.  Maybe.", "date": "2015-11-09 23:52:21"}

National Underground is one of those reasons, because it's so unlike any other bar on the street.  It's never crowded, it's very 'low-key'.  The bands are very good (the band there when I was last in, Brian Wain's Hushpuppy's Daddy, was phenomenal), I've never had to pay a cover, the beers are reasonably priced, the staff are always exceptionally nice, and it just has a really good non-pretentious vibe that is missing from its neighbors.  I've never had the food, but I am anxious to try it.\n\nThe reason it's docked a star, then? When you ask for a water, they charge you $2 and give you a 16oz bottle. No bueno, guys.  Fix that, and you'll get five stars.", "date": "2014-12-04 00:39:56"}

Not rude or anything, just way too scatterbrained to be a waiter.  I think just about every other waiter in the place was great though. We did have a couple other waiters help out at our table though, and they were very good. \n\nFood - The bread was nice, but the butter was darn near frozen solid. The salads were great, and they come with every entree (always a good thing!). I highly recommend the Creole Vinaigrette. My husband tried the Spicy Blue Cheese and it wasn't nearly as good as the vinaigrette. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi, which was excellent. I later found out that it's actually the staff favorite. My husband ordered the Crawfish Etouffee and it was very, very bland. DO NOT order the Crawfish Etouffee if you decide to visit. Fix yourself some Zataran's at home for better flavor. \n\nDecor - This restaurant is very pretty. It's very elegant with beautiful chandeliers, dark woods, and pretty linen tablecloths. However, on our visit we saw everything from suits to shorts, so don't worry about having to get dressed up. Anything goes here. \n\nOverall - I would go back and just cross my fingers and hope for a better waiter. The shrimp scampi is definitely worth a repeat visit.", "date": "2009-03-26 16:02:37"}

I'm not sure if all Dierbergs have a dine-in area, but they make great lunch spots for eating all of the awesome home cooked food you can get at their deli and sushi bars!\n\nWe like it because Dierbergs deli has a great selection of real food that you can get small portions of and either have them heat it up or you can take it to the little lunch area and heat it up yourself. Most of the time we get either sushi or the baked chicken dinner which for 6 bucks gets you a chicken breast and leg, plus two sides and a dinner roll! Today we opted out of the sushi and went for the chicken as you can see by my before and after pics. Sometimes we get yummy desserts from the deli too.\n\nAnother reason we really like to eat in the store is because it seems like a place that older people, blue collar workers and stay at home mom's like to also have their lunch. Its nice to get out of the office cafeteria and be around something other than your working class lunch crowd at all of the traditional lunch hour spots. It's more like sitting down at a dinner table and taking it easy over some good home cooking.\n\nOne time we'll always remember is when a cute little old man started talking to us as we were getting ready to leave, asking us where we worked and so forth. We told him we worked at a health and medical sciences book publisher and he asked me, oh so you're not a nurse then? I told him no, he looked sad for a second and said, Oh I was hoping that you'd check me out and see if i'm healthy, then with a wink and a chuckle, he sent us on our way.", "date": "2010-05-20 19:26:05"}

Most of the menu is variations of their specialty dish, a soup/stew called sun du bu.  It's got a red broth and lots of tofu as well some meat or something else, depending on the variety you order.  The soup is literally boiling when it arrives at your table, and depending on how you order it, it's pretty hot in the other way, also.  You are provided with a raw egg to crack into the soup if you wish.  You also get a pot of rice, a variety of tiny side dishes and a drink that I understand is essentially iced tea made with buckwheat instead of tea.\n\nMy three companions and I really enjoyed this place.  The one problem we had was that one of our friends is a strict vegetarian and it was difficult for us to determine which things on the menu were truly vegetarian, partly because of the limited English of the servers.  She doesn't want meatless soup if it is made with beef broth, for example. It was pretty clear that we weren't going to be able to communicate that to our waitress, so she got the pancake with scallions.  \n\nI'll be back, especially on a cold day!", "date": "2008-09-20 18:55:00"}

As we were looking at the property map we were approached by a hotel staff who RUDELY informed us that if we were looking for somewhere to eat we should go some place else since all of the restaurants were booked with private parties.  We still walked around some just to see the gardens, and even the possibility of a snack at one of the counter service facilities.  This was 8pm on a Wednesday night, every counter service facility was closed & as the rep indicated every restaurant was closed for private parties.  We came back the next night in hopes that Wednesday was an unusual circumstance, however once again 7pm on a Thursday and every restaurant except one was booked for private parties, a couple of the counter service facilities were open like the Gelatto shop, but we really wanted to have a vice dinner. I had considered staying at the hotel and I'm very grateful we we did not. Needless to say we did not return for our third and final night nor we will ever return when we visit our daughter who will be attending college in Nashville starting in the fall.

The location is pretty easy to get to as long as it isn't rush hour, and they have plenty of parking in the parking lot for the strip mall of businesses that they are set up in. There is quite a bit of outdoor seating in a patio area in front of the business, and a lot more seating inside that is composed of some second-hand mismatched furniture (including a few couches). Ordering is done at their bar that has a large chalkboard behind it with the available beers on tap.\n \nIt's a fairly busy interior with lots of stuff hanging everywhere, including a significant amount of awards that they have won for their beers. There are also lots of branded items that you can buy. They have 6-packs of their canned beer already cold that you can purchase to-go, or you can make a build your own 6 pack. You can also fill growlers here. The beers from this brewery are always done exceptionally well for the style, but they also lack some of the more unique beers that a lot of other breweries like to make. They have 8 or 9 beers on tap at any time, and they usually cover a decent spectrum of beer styles. This is definitely a brewery that isn't going to put out anything that isn't done well.\n\nThey have quite a few unique events here that can be easily found on their website, including a night especially for dogs, live music, and even a euchre night. Wednesday is their pint night with the fantastic offering of $4 pints. There was a food truck here the last time I visited, but I think that is only a once a week occasion (but don't quote me on that). They did have a few snack items available if needed to buy something to tide you over while drinking. \n\nI don't make it here very often since it requires a drive to get here, but it is definitely a stop I would make if I was going to be in the area. If you like great beer in a relaxed atmosphere, this is definitely your place. Additionally, and this may be a little judgmental of me, but the crowd here seems to be a little more \"normal\" than some other breweries. It's not full of regulars that feel like they have priority in the place and there are far less hipsters than some of the downtown breweries pull in. It's a nice social place to come with some friends to enjoy a few beers no matter what demographic you belong to.", "date": "2017-06-28 17:31:56"}

Took my family to the Christmas show and had a blast. Went to the Brew Brothers and was very disappointed. We started out with chips and salsa with the guacamole.

Later she said it was jalape\u00f1o. I'm can't have anything spicy due to an ulcer. I told the waitress why don't you tell people it has jalape\u00f1o in it? She did say anything.             So we order and I had the smoked chicken and pineapple. At that time I asked for more water and my daughter asked for ranch. A few minutes later our food arrived everyone but mine. The waitress said it would be only a few minutes. So everyone started eating. 10 minutes later I man came over and apologize for my dinner said they had some problems in the kitchen and it would be a few minutes. So about 5-7 minutes my chicken arrived. Now my family was mostly done eating. I looked at my plate and it's small chicken peace's with chunks of pineapple. Not much chicken. The bbq sauce was lightly poured on to it. So I tried it and no smoke flavor and it was very dry. I was expecting a little more the that.  The waitress forgot our water and ranch dip we had to ask several times. No apology or compensation for the spicy guacamole or dinner issue.

Seriously, not sure what they do to it here, but it is great!  \n\nI sat at the sushi bar and watched the chef's make their magic, but there is a lot of other booths and table seatings fro groups or couples.  I went stag today....oh well :)  \n\nThe best roll I had was the 2011.  Salmon, cream cheese and avocado fried in a bit of tempura batter.  Excellent!  They have a great selection of domestic and Japanese imported beers as well.  \n\nAnother great thing about this place is they do deliveries and stay open until 2 am!!!

We arrived around 7 and had the place nearly to ourselves (World Cup time, you know). The bartender/server was very accommodating when it came to the wine list and trying out different things.  The wine list is gargantuan, by the way. Thank goodness my friend knows wine better than I and was able to help me choose. \n\nWe were seated quickly.  Warm rolls came to the table first (with REAL butter!!). Our order of the ceviche pescado sampler arrived quickly along with yucca fries and chorizo y morcilla. \n\nCeviche was fresh and the \"Peruvian hot\" was perfect for us - not burn your face off hot, but nicely spiced with good flavor. While the yucca fries came with their own sauce, I preferred using the left over ceviche sauce.\n\nThe morcilla was pretty fantastic in my opinion.  I wasn't crazy about the chorizo, but it was good as well. \n\nDessert was an incredibly rich double chocolate cake. I mean, just wow. Since we were stuffed I rescued about half of it for tomorrow's breakfast!! \n\nAll in all, I really loved eating here. The food, the atmosphere, the people and service - all really made this dinner an enjoyable experience I hope to revisit soon.

We were salivating over THEIR food so obviously that I think we made them uncomfortable. When our order was finally taken, we over-ordered: saganaki, dolmades, fries, eggplant fries, beef tenderloin gyro, extra pita, orzo, spanokopita. This was for two people! Everything was good, fresh tasting. The gyro wasn't what I expected, on a bed of mashed potatoes not on a pita, but was very flavorful. Also the dolmades were hot, not cold as I've usually had them.\n\nService was friendly, though sometimes AWOL. There was live music which was great! Decor was a mishmash of styles.

The vibe of this place is definitely a burger and brew joint - In order for me to return to a place like that, there have to really be some standout items on the menu or a standout vibe in atmosphere.

It was hard by passing Roma's my favorite local place to taste this, but I am an equal opportunity provider.  Called up and order two large which were ready fairly quickly.  Descently priced which was about 17.95 before tax.  A little disappointed though off the bat as their large is a 16\".  When I brought it home knew right away this paled in comparison to the other local joints.  The crust was a dead give away as it seemed to be premade frozen stuff, not the fresh dough.  I've encountered crust like this at other places such as Fiesta II on Henry which doesn't help only hurt the rating.  Nothing stood out about the sauce or cheese, real mediocre.  Friendly and conveniently located for me which garnishes a 3.  Don't think I'll be returning for the pizza, but might give some other menu items a try.", "date": "2013-05-14 12:30:35"}

After I stressed \"no animal products, no egg, no dairy, no butter,\" the server responded with \"oh well you know the egg isn't actually meat\" as opposed to, you know, respecting my dietary restrictions.\n\nI have no intention of returning, due to the lack of clarity on the menu and the server's rudeness when I was expressing my allergies/restrictions. Maybe if the restaurant lists all of the ingredients and trains their staff on how to not be rude to someone who was rightfully annoyed at almost getting an item I couldn't eat, then it might be worth a recommendation.

At least they didn't charge me when I told them I couldn't find a space.\n\nFinally got parked and made it to the restaurant.  They said the wait would be 30 minutes and it ended up being about 45 minutes.  No big deal cause we weren't in a hurry or anything.  I ordered the abalone with rice special.
